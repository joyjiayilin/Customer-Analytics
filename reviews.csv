B000KK53L6,2008,4,5.0,3,3,242,"excellent product","i am 44 years old and have suffered with severe breakouts for all of my adult life. i have tried everything from proactive to expensive prescription meds and very fancy dermatological treatments and peels. i don't see my dermatologist anymore, though he was sweet. perhaps if he were cuter... i digress. my skin was becoming worse with pustule breakouts all along my nose and chin. i felt embarrassed to leave the house since i didn't want anyone to see me. i tried the acne free severe treatment and i started to see results within a few days. in two weeks my skin had cleared and within a month was cleared completely. my skin is not sensitive so i didn't experience any burning or itching. i think that the negative reviews on this product are from people with overly sensitive skin. there's nothing that works for everyone, but it's great for me. i've been using it for over five months and while i'll get an occasional pimple it's completely manageable. all the other things i've used worked initially but stopped working after only two or three months.  the last skincare regimen i used cost over $1100. it worked a full four months before losing its potency. i'm going to try switching over to the regular acne free kit for maintenance to be sure my skin doesn't somehow get ""used"" to the acne free severe. try this, i hope it works out for you."
B000KK53L6,2008,1,5.0,3,3,113,"Be patient, it really works.","I used this product after using Proactiv for a year and trying other products. Proactiv seemed to allow horrible breakouts to occur, but clear them up sort of quickly. I happened to be looking for Proactiv at Walgreens when I stumbled upon this and decided to give it a try. It made my skin very dry in the beginning, but after the purchase of a non-oil based moisturizer, it works much better than Proactiv has ever done. I receive compliments about how clear my skin is frequently now. So, if you're going to do it, purchase a nice moisturizer and give it a week or two, following the steps carefully. You'll be satisfied."
B000KK53L6,2007,3,5.0,3,3,184,"This product really works.","I have tried it all and this is the only product that has worked for me.  I came across Acnefree while traveling through the U.S. last November and I have to say it is the best investment I ever made for my skin.		I normally don't have the patience for a beauty regime that involves more than a couple of products so when I saw 4 items in the package I was skepticle whether I would stick to following the routine.  It really is very simple to use and doesn't take more than a few minutes to apply after the skin has been cleansed.		I would say within a couple of days after commencing use of the products my breakouts were reduced to almost nil and shortly thereafter the problem was completely cleared.  My skin is still somewhat oily by the end of the day but my pores no longer get blocked.		Thank you University Medical for making a product that actually delivers on its promise, is very reasonably priced and has given me the beautiful complexion I have tried for years to attain."
B000KK53L6,2011,11,5.0,5,6,1145,"Fast resuts!!!!","I'm now 22 years old, and I've been struggling with acne for most of my life. I've tried everything from Proactive, to prescription pills, topical medicine from dermatologists, and most recently, MaxClarity. I wouldn't say that I have extremely severe acne, however I am constantly plagued with cystic acne, whiteheads, or just ugly clusters of pimples. My acne usually forms around my mouth, chin and sometimes  my cheeks and will typically take weeks to heal. When I break out, my self esteem is pretty much non-existent and I hate going out because I think the only thing people see is my acne!!! Most recently I found temporary success using MaxClarity. MaxClarity made my skin soft, and at some points I was completely pimple-free, it was amazing! However, my clear face was short-lived, and I'd have a horrible acne flare-up that would take weeks to heal. In addition, I would always break out regardless during that time of the month. I was able to put up with the roller-coaster success of MaxClarity because sometimes I would have perfect skin that would boost my confidence...however, in the past couple of weeks my acne has been the worst it's EVER BEEN!!! I began to question whether my skin could no longer be helped by MaxClarity. I became desperate for another skin regimen. I've read though probably hundreds of amazon reviews for various acne products trying to find something that might work. That is when I stumbled on Acnefree Severe. I read all of the amazon reviews for this product and decided it was the most feasible to get in a short amount of time to start treating my horrible acne ASAP, plus it had the most positive reviews of any acne product. Now, I'm nearing the end of the first week of using Acnefree Severe. I have to say, so far, it seems awesome!!! Within the first 2 days, I could see that it was starting to dry out my pre-existing acne. Within 4 days, the acne inflamation was almost 90% decreased!!!! My face is looking clearer already. I've been following the instructions dilligently, and just today purchased the spot acne treatment and sulfur mask to see if that will speed up results. Ultimately, I can say that for only 5 days of use, I'm already seeing results!!! I'm hoping that within 2 weeks my skin will be completely clear (seeing as how my progress is now). While I am still forming a few pimples (although less red, not cystic, and not as obvious), I assume that this is just a result of Acnefree purging my face of any soon-to-form acne. My face is feeling soft, my acne is less red and inflamed and easy to cover up with make-up. I've rarely seen a product produce noticeable results in such a short amount of time after using it. Ultimately, I would suggest this product to anybody that can have fairly severe breakouts, but breakouts that have been temporarily manageable in the past. The chemical strength of Acnefree is probably NOT ideal for somebody with the occasional pimple or hormonal flare-up. I'm really hoping that this product works in the long run! I will make sure to write another review in a couple weeks to document the affectiveness of this product. As someone who has been struggling with acne for years and wondering why I'm not the lucky girl that has pimple free skin with no effort, I hope this product works!!!		It has now been about 4 weeks since I started using Acnefree Severe. For the record, my skin looks amazing!!!! My previous breakouts are completely cleared up at this point, and any acne marks are noticeably faded/continuing to fade. For anyone beginning to use this product, GIVE IT TIME. Even if your skin isn't responding to the product as quickly as others, it seems as if AcneFree takes time (although honestly not that much compared to other products) to fully clear skin. One absolute recommendation when using this product is to use a VERY GOOD moisturizer day and night. The strength of the chemicals will likely dry out and irritate most peoples' skin, so a oil-free, strong moisturizer will help combat that dryness. In addition, after a couple weeks of use I noticed that the Step 4 retinoid cream wasn't doing much for my skin, in fact it seemed to make my forehead break out a little. I changed the routine so I use Steps 1 & 2 at night, and then apply the acne spot treatment (sold separately) to any acne. This allows me to skip the 10 minute waiting time after application of Step 2, and it seems to be helping my skin along even more. However, this may not work for everybody, so I would recommend experimenting with this step if you find Step 4 isn't useful. As someone who has been struggling with acne for so long, I couldn't be happier with the results AcneFree Severe has given me. At this point, I would STILL recommend AcneFree to anyone similarly struggling with acne and self-esteem. I hope this product works for you too!!		3/6/12	It has now been almost 3 months since I started using this product. Let me just say, that as someone who has struggled with acne for SO LONG and have broken down crying because of the horrible acne on my face, I can say now that my face is the best it has ever looked! I still use steps 1,2&3 in the morning, 1&2 at night with the Acne Spot Treatment. So far, my skin has been almost 100% clear, with only a few pimples arising now and then. I find that using the acne spot treatment at night instead of step 4 clears up any stray pimples extremely quickly (2-3 days). I would still absolutely suggest using a good moisturizer morning and night to combat the dryness of the benzyl peroxide. When I had horrible acne before, I'd have to constantly run to the mirror to cover up my spots with concealer, in addition to wearing lots of foundation. Now, my skin looks amazing with just a thin layer of light foundation and a little bit of concealer to cover up fading acne marks, plus it looks good ALL DAY. I am no longer self conscious and can be more myself without worrying about how people see me. If you are struggling with frequent breakouts that don't seem to be clearing up, I would HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS PRODUCT. It is absolutely amazing, I can't even say enough about it. The key to any acne product is that it works in the long term, and so far it seems to be doing just that. Please please please give this product a try because I have a feeling it will help you just as much as it helped me :)"
B000KK53L6,2012,2,5.0,2,2,223,"Sooooo happy!  Use sparingly.","I have been having problems with acne, mostly my cheeks and chin area, after stopping birth control age 28.  I was miserable and embarrassed by my face. I am soooo happy that I bough Acnefree Severe.  In just 3 days my face it 80% completely clear.		I was scared from some of the reviews about it being really harsh on skin, peeling, burning etc.  If you just take it kind of slow at the beginning and use only the minimal amount each time then you should be fine.		The first day I only used 1,2,3 day and night to get my face introduced to it.  The the second night I used 1,2,4 (do not use 3 and 4 together).  Also, be sure to apply sparingly.  A little bit goes a long way. Dab a small amount and use one or two fingers to massage it.  I think if you oversaturate your face with this stuff you can actually cause damage and/or experience a worsening effect before it gets better.		In the beginning if you do get irritated red spots just use 1 and 2 on that area until it settles back down before you start putting 3 or 4 in that area again.		The scars/blotches on my face are disappearing.		My husband noticed my face looked better in just one day.		Love it!!"
B000KK53L6,2012,0,5.0,2,2,228,"This is a miracle in plastic containers!!!","I've only been using this product for 8 days. Some people may say it's too soon to review; however, ""some people"" do not have acne as bad as I DID. I've got that- ""made an appt. with a dermatologist, but he was too busy to see me so I had to see the physician assistant instead; when I got to the office, she took one look at my face and said """"oh my God, I've got to get the doctor for this"""" -kind of skin. I have cystic acne combined with REALLY sensitive skin. I can't even spray perfumes on certain parts of my body without it breaking out really, really bad. Complete strangers walk up to me and ask me what am I using on my skin. How embarrassing is that? I wake up EVERY morning with whiteheads and/or blackheads on my face. My chest and back look like my face x20. Antibiotics,Proactive,and Murad only made the situation worse. I stopped eating fatty foods and I lost weight, but the acne continue to get worse the older I get. I drank only water for months at a time, but that did no good. Finally, hundreds of dollars later, I decided to give this product a try. This is the best my skin has looked in over 15 years. I was a skeptic, but trust me, this works."
B000KK53L6,2011,10,5.0,2,2,98,"Great product!","I've had severe acne problems since HS and I could never get rid of it even into adulthood. I did use Accutane, but stopped because I was not fond of the side effects. This product has been great! After a week of using the product, I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin. After a few weeks following the directions, my acne cleared. My friends and family commented on how quickly my acne went away. Since I do not want to strip my skin, I now use the product once every other day as part of my regimen."
B000KK53L6,2011,9,5.0,2,2,827,Amazing!,"I never leave reviews but given how much I rely on reviews, I figured it was about time I started contributing!		I had fairly heavy acne growing up, especially in my t-zone, which came under control when I began birth control pills when I turned 18.  For the past 10 years, I have been fortunate enough to not have difficulties with acne except for the occasional zit.  However, a few months ago I stopped taking birth control and I was dismayed to see that the acne had returned, albeit not as bad as when I was a teenager, and had moved more to my jawline/cheeks.  I began washing religiously and using toner but it didn't seem to make a difference - as soon as one would go away, two more would pop up.  At 28, I felt that I was TOO OLD to be having these problems!  But there they were.		I tried ProActiv for a month and was pretty pleased with the results.  It cleared the majority of my acne and the big cystic ones stopped coming.  However, I was still regularly getting very small zits which would typically clear within a few days.  All in all, I was pleased and figured I could deal with the occasional small zit that could be covered relatively easily with make up.  After about 3 weeks, I noticed that my supply was getting low and it was time to re-order.  I wasn't crazy about spending all that money, but was happy with the results so I was ready to do it......until I read the reviews for Acne Free Severe.		I was hesitant to try it.  I didn't want to go back to the way my skin was and I figured if I was pleased, why rock the boat?  In the end, I decided if I was going to get a long-term regime, I should at least try the product that was MUCH cheaper than ProActiv and I am SO HAPPHY that I did!		Within 3 days of using AcneFree, it cleared the small zits that ProActiv couldn't seem to keep under control.  I have been using AcneFree day and night for the last 5 weeks and have not had a single new zit.  It also seems to be lightening the scars left from previous breakouts.  I have not had the problems of the product severely drying out my skin as others have noted.  I use steps 1 and 2 each morning when I wake up and each evening.  In the mornings, I follow with step 3 and at night, I skip step 3 and use step 4.		A few observations:	- AcneFree is not great at removing make up.  I have to start with a make up remover (I use Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser) or I have to use 3-4 pads with toner on it to remove everything.  If I start with the make up remover and follow with the 3 AcneFree steps, I get a great cleaning and starting with the make up remover only adds a minute to the routine.	- I was a bit concerned after switching from ProActiv to AcneFree because I felt the AcneFree wash did not have as many grains as the ProActiv and was concerned that it wouldn't work as well - it works BETTER.  If you're switching from ProActiv, don't let that concern you.	- AcneFree didn't come with the many instructions provided by ProActiv.  Having using ProActiv, I knew that I needed to wash with a dime sized amount.  I wonder if those who have had issues with this product drying their skin out are using more than that?	- AcneFree will bleach your clothes or towels if you're not careful.  Its not as obvious as when you get cleaning products on your clothes that have bleach on it, but I do notice a slight fading on some of my towels.  I don't particularly mind because the towels I use for drying my face aren't my 'nice' towels, but this is something to remember.	- You do tend to go through the toner more quickly than the other products.  I am going to take the advice of another reviewer and pick up the Thayers Witch Hazel to use in its place.	- Make sure you never use all four steps or you will likely dry your skin out.  It should be steps 1+2 and then 3 OR 4.		This has worked so well that my husband, who has always used Retinol A cream (which is not covered by insurance due to him not being a teenager) has decided to switch to this product.  I am very excited to have found this product and I am planning on using it long-term.  The price is great for the product - At this rate, it looks like I will go through a package about every 2-2.5 months which makes it less than half the cost of ProActiv for the same amount of product."
B000KK53L6,2011,3,5.0,2,2,269,"Only thing that works/ use it with Alba Moisturizer","I've always had acne, but even now at 30 years old, it started to get worse!  Nothing would work, and I found this by luck at a expensive store, and IT WORKED!  My skin is pretty tough, so it hasn't irritated my skin at all.  I don't know if this product helped, but I  use ALBA  aloe & green tea oil-free moisturizer after I put on the three step.  The moisturizer is EXPENSIVE, but it soothes the skin, and smells great! I also use Clearasil Ultra Rapid Ultra pad. To get that deep down clean just in case the face wash missing anything. For me my face has never been clearer.  Now that I've run out, I'm starting to break out again.  So I guess I should have some on backup for next time.  I put the codes for the other two products down below for anyone who wanted it.  So once again..		1. Wash your face with a face scub	2. Use the Clearasi Ultra Cleansing Pads to get that deep down clean or anything you missed	3. Use the Acne treatmen, and Repair Lotion	4. Use Alba Aloe & Green Tea Mosiurizer		After my face stared to clear up, I found that ANY face scrub will due, and you could actually skip the repair lotion and use the Alba Moisturizer by itself,, but Unfortunately you can't buy the acne medication by itself,, but regardless, it's worth it to get the best skin possible for me.		<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001V9QL0C"">CLEARASIL ULTRA CLEANSING PADS 90 EACH</a>	<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET7BPS"">Alba Botanica Aloe & Green Tea Oil Free Moisturizer, 3-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a>"
B000KK53L6,2011,1,5.0,2,2,35,"Wonderful Outcome!","Worked wonders that many others could not do!  Cleared in two weeks what even prescribed had not done after years of trying. My skin looks better now than it has looked in over 10 years!!!"
B000KK53L6,2010,5,5.0,1,1,362,"Best I ever tried","I'm 35 years old and I've had severe acne since I was about 14.  I took antibiotics as a teen for it...it hasn't remained at THAT severe level, but I still have quite a bit of issues with my complexion, especially considering at my age its usually not an issue.		I finally decided to try something more expensive so I saw this at Walmart and picked it up.  Wow!!!  My face is REALLY looking better.  Yeah I still get a pimple or two here or there but overall my complexion is so much improved.		A few thoughts...		First, the toner goes way faster than everything else.  My kit has lasted about 2 months and I'm about ready for a new kit.  But after like 3 weeks I needed to order more toner, so I just got the regular AcneFree toner, a big bottle of it, on Ebay.  It works just as well.		Speaking of the toner....Its AMAZING how much dirt it takes off your face, even right after I've scrubbed my face in the shower!  No wonder I was breaking out....there's so much dirt hiding here and there in my pores and face its not even funny.		Anyway...also beware that the cleanser and the morning lotion contains benzoyl peroxide and it WILL bleach your towels, pillowcases, and clothes if you are not careful.  The night cream contains retinol and that does not bleach, and the toner is just soothing and cleansing.		I love how the retinol smooths your skin at night and the toner also feels great...and the peroxide works during the day.  I have not had my face irritated or dried out at all using this.  Before I replaced the toner, I tried some Neutrogena acne toner and it dried out my face and I started breaking out.  When I went back to using all four steps of the AcneFree, I cleared back up.		The only bad thing is I'd like to use this on my chest as well but I'm afraid of bleaching my clothes so I do not.		Anyway I'm really happy with this and would recommend it to anyone, and am getting ready to buy my second kit."
B000KK53L6,2010,3,5.0,1,1,315,"Works Well (A guys perspective)","I'm 23 and have had acne issues since I was about 17, started mild, then got bad starting about age 19. I have used Clearasil, Pro-Active, Oxy, and countless other treatments, but this product has worked the best for me. I would say when using mild acne treatments i would get about a lot of pimples with a bunch of redness on my face. After using this product I get about 4-5 pimples a month and little to no redness on face. For a lot of the month my skin looks great with no visible acne!	I have been using Acne Free Sever for about 8-12 months now and it has proven to work well for me. I do caution others those (as many other reviewers have pointed out) THIS STUFF IS POTENT. The lotion burned for about the first week of application, then my skin got used to it. Another suggestion that I highly recommend would be using an oil free moisturizer with the product. Now I know a lot of guys don't use moisturizer, but honestly guys, this product WILL dry out your skin and which would you rather have, dry flaky skin or smooth soft skin?	Overall I really like this product, but I am currently looking for other products. I know its wierd to write in a review with a 5 star rating, but the truth of the matter is that this stuff is about the strongest thing you can get over the counter. If something less potent can get me close to the results of the product, I'm going to use it as I'm sure it would be better for my skin. But if you have tried a bunch of other products and they didn't seem to work for you, or if  regular strength Acne Free worked well, but just not well enough this may be the product for you."
B000KK53L6,2010,3,5.0,1,1,178,"Very Potent System","I have extremely oily skin (its crazy). It took two weeks for the system to dry my skin out and for me to see results. Proactive/Clearasil could not make a dent in my skin after 2 months. This stuff is EXTREMELY potent and you will feel it after the first application.		Your skin will dry out and start flaking at which point I suggest you do STEP 3 less or start using an oil free moisturizer. Also, do not put this stuff near your eyes they will burn.  After 2 weeks my skin started healing extremely fast. New acne was reduced to nothing and old acne started clearing up.		Few things to note:		1. DO NOT PUT THIS ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR EYES	2. Step 1 - I used a stronger exfoliating scrub with the cleanser provided (extremely oily skin)	3. Step 4 - Skin feels amazing after waking up. Make sure your face is dry completely before applying		Also, if you have sensitive skin I suggest you go with something more mild. This stuff is strong as advertised."
B000KK53L6,2010,0,3.0,1,1,111,"Works Well For Now","I am 35 years old and have been suffering from acne since I turned an adult. I've been using this product for 3 days and I see improvements I never got with Proactive or from my dermatologist. The irritating bumps and whiteheads are disappearing but I must say that the step 3 lotion can irritate and burn all day. Do Not get it anywhere near your lips or eyelids!		I'm going to continue with it. I long for the day when my skin is clear and I don't have to wear make-up to 'hide' flaws and black marks over my face. I pray this works for me in the long run"
B000KK53L6,2009,9,5.0,1,1,175,"A Great Product","About a 3weeks ago I started using this product. I have hormonal acne which is one of the hardest forms of acne to treat on skin, because the problem is from within. Now when I say my skin was bad, it was so bad I can't go anywhere without makeup.	When I started using this product i saw a little difference by a week. It wasn't that noticeable, but I noticed my skin was drying up. I continued using it, but my skin never got excessively dry. Its just perfect. I noticed that I totally stopped breaking out, and no the spots are disappearing. I can't remember the last time i washed my face without feeling acne/pimples on my face. I cant actually say that now.	I believe people that don't have severe acne get their skin dried out too much.	This is a great product and as it says its better than proactiv. I have used proactiv and didn't see much of a difference. This product made all the difference.	I love this product."
B000KK53L6,2009,8,5.0,1,1,201,"Got rid of my acne in a heartbeat.","I've used many acne products such as Proactiv, Daniel Kern's, and other various products with salicylic acid (Stridex pads) and the likes, and I found this to work the best out of all of them. It doesn't slightly reduce the size of white heads, but rather, completely eradicates any trace of it, and results are delivered in just a couple of days.		Some word of caution, however.		This stuff is very concentrated, and you should follow the directions VERY carefully. 10% benzoyl peroxide, in abundance over a long period of time, has the potential to leave scars, so don't glob a lot of this stuff over a whitehead hoping to make it go away overnight.		Also if you live in a hot area and find yourself sweating a lot (Arizona), keep this stuff AWAY from any articles of clothing, because it can and will bleach your clothes very badly. Even the act of wiping the sweat off your face and wiping it off on your shirt will leave a bleach mark that will not come out.		I've been using this stuff since 2008, and it has not failed me yet. Just be aware that it's strong stuff that shouldn't be underestimated."
B000KK53L6,2009,1,4.0,1,1,325,"give it a try, it definitely works","I used to have some acne when I was a teenager but I got the worst acne ever in my mid 20s. I tried everything for years with no results until I saw this product and decided to give it a try. I saw results quickly. Actually, the first couple of days it dried my skin up a little bit and I got a bad burning around my eyes. But the instructions clearly say not to use the product on the eyes area and I did, so it was my fault, (and I also overused it on my urge to get rid of my acne no matter what) Anyway, as soon as I saw the product dried my skin up, I just easily worked it out by following the instructions on how to use the product plus using some good day/night moisturizers by The Body Shop (I love their products).	My skin began to look much better in a few days, the repair lotion really works. My severe acne disappeared and now I just have to cope with few regular breakouts like once in a while and I can fight them with the repair lotion. I think this stuff really kills acne bacteria and most of the time prevents breakouts from attacking again!	But remember, you must follow the instructions and not overuse it cause it can burn your skin! and you need to use it constantly and be patient to get the best results!. One more thing, we are all different and every skin type may show a different reaction to this product, so, even though I can tell the product has been working awesome for me since I got it, this is just and opinion/advice according to my personal experience.	As I mentioned it before, bear in mind that acnefree might dry up your skin, but you can work it out with a moisturizer and that's a whole lot better than fighting acne!"
B000KK53L6,2009,0,2.0,1,1,60,"Worked pretty well but too harsh","I used the original acnefree and felt I needed something a little stronger. As soon as I started using acnefree severe I started seeing results, however after about a week of using it my skin began burning and having dry spots. My skin usually tolerates acne treatments pretty well, but step 3 the day time lotion was just too harsh."
B000KK53L6,2009,0,5.0,1,1,101,"It really works!","I have had acne for a long long time, many years. Thought it would dissapear after teenage years but i guess not, 26 years old now. I got scars from them too. I've tried all kinds of stuff and i really love this product. It really improves my skin. Not just takes away the acne but it looks and feels better too. My skin does not get irritated from it. It doesn't dry it out like other products can. It really works for me and my skintype. I tried the acnefree not severe one but acnefree severe works best for me."
B000KK53L6,2008,10,5.0,1,1,23,"excellent product","AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment is the best product on the market. I have never had a acne treatment work so well for me."
B000KK53L6,2010,0,5.0,0,0,92,"Proactive should prepare to go out of business","I've been battling with acne for over 3 years now.	I've tried Proactive and many other acne treatments.		And I finally found the solution to this acne maze.		I have been using ""AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment System"" for 2 days as of now, and I am seeing the difference!	I can see acnes disappearing! It works!!		Proactive didn't work for me, but this one did!		While using PROACTIVE, I felt uncomfortable wearing the toner and lotion.. (It tends to make	my skin look greasy) but AcneFree doesn't have that problem.		Definately recommended!"
B000KK53L6,2010,0,4.0,0,0,324,"Works good, but is VERY strong","I started using this product 2 months ago when I was 5 months pregnant. The product says not to use while pregnant unless consulting physician but I was comfortable with using it since my face ALWAYS breaks out horribly when I am pregnant, and this is the third time so this is nothing new to me. I have used Proactiv, clearasil, oxy pads, pretty much everything. At first I used the acne free system as directed, but it was too strong for my skin, my face became raw and BURNED like nothing else I have ever felt. So I stopped using the gritty lotion, except for on problem areas, and within 4 days i felt 100 percent better, and when the skin healed, the bad acne had cleared. Now With just using the wash, toner, and night cream, my face has made a dramatic turn around, I still get occasional pimples, on my cheek area and still have some minor blackheads but all in all this product worked good for me. My skin feels great, and definately smoother. I love how non-abrasive the wash is, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and not like I just scrubbed it with a brillo-pad. I will probably try to use the lotion again once I am no longer pregnant and see if I get a different reaction but for now the other 3 steps are working just great. I had also had some MINOR acne on my shoulders, within 1 week of using the system that had cleared up and I havent had any problems with my shoulders since. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of stubborn acne. You just have to remember that even though it may come over night, your acne is not going to cure over night, and acne products WILL dry your skin out and irritate it for a while, but that means that it is working."
B000KK53L6,2009,11,5.0,0,0,311,Success,"I bought this off Amazon about a month and a half ago because of the many positive reviews. I have had acne since I was 12, although I let it go untreated most of that time. Now I'm 24 and decided enough was enough, I bought this kit even though my acne is no longer what I consider ""severe"" (although it has been in the past as the scars left behind can attest to) My skin is oily and not particularly sensitive so I felt confident I could handle an over the counter severe acne treatment kit. Immediately before I started using this I had been using a generic 5% benzoyl peroxide cream, that had been over drying my face. (I define over drying as when my skin starts flaking)		With all that said, this is a fantastic product, especially for the price. Proactiv goes for $40 on Amazon and this stuff sells for almost half that. Also, this kit did not overdry my skin as straight benzoyl peroxide treatments have done. I imagine some people might have a drying problem, but just use some moisturizer and you should be good to go. As with any acne treatment the key is being consistent. If you start missing applications acne Will come back.		Of course the bottom line is results, this product absolutely cleared up all my acne in a little under a month. It's hard to express in words how happy I am looking in the mirror now and seeing a clear complexion looking back at me.		The only downside I can think of is that step 4 comes in a small 1 ounce container and will most likely run out before the rest of the kit does. Other than that I give this product my full reccomendation with consistent use it will most likely clear up most cases of acne."

It is now 6 weeks later and his pimples are not totally gone but his acne is much less severe than it was.		At first his face burned and dried out a little, but his face now seems used to the product.  The #2 gets used up much quicker than the rest of the products.		When he misses a day using all of the steps, we notice the difference.		Hopefully, in another few months all of his pimples will be gone.  If not, at least his face looks MUCH BETTER than before."

I have very oily skin, and I have new breakouts almost daily - ah the wonders of genetics. After my first use my skin felt great, and over the last few days I haven't had any new breakouts, and the ones I have seem to be getting smaller. I have to say, I've used a million acne treatments, and this is one of the first ones I've ever used that didn't make my face 10 times worse before it got better.. We'll see if that turns out to be a good thing or not.		All in all, so far my face is feeling so much better. My breakouts started clearing up almost immediately, and no more have formed. Even my mom commented that it seemed to be working. I'm loving this product so far, and will definetly continue to use it. I'll let you know how it goes when i've been using it longer."

I have the type of acne that usually pops up right before my monthly cycle, then takes forever to heal, and this product starts making a huge dent in the acne overnight. I've been able to prolong the life of the package that I bought by only using it when I start to break out. It's been working really well for me. It hasn't dried out my skin, which is really surprising. The lotion does tend to make my face a little greasy, so I try not to use very much of it.	I've only had one problem: one night when I first started using it, I was really tired and in a hurry to go to bed. I forgot to wait at least 10 minutes between steps 3 and 4, and I ended up turning my pillow case orange. I've been really careful to follow the directions exactly since then and haven't had any problems."

My skin was tremendously dry. (So, just FYI...if you have a function or a party that you need to go to, consider using this afterwards, because it takes a few days for your face to clear the stubborn acnes and other after effects) I can almost tell, I used the Step 3 lotion more than what I should. AVOID the eye and lip area, especially if you have sensitive skin! But after a couple of days, I can definitely tell some amazing results!		HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE SUFFERING WITH ""SEVERE ACNE""		For a fraction of the cost, it's worth having clear skin all over again.		Inferiority Complex...GONE!"
B000KK53L6,2008,11,5.0,0,0,183,"Excellent!  Excellent!  Excellent!","I wouldn't classify my skin as ""severe"" at all, in fact, my skin tends to be clear most of the time.  I'll get the occassional pimple or blackhead here and there, but nothing severe whatsoever.		I began using this product because my brother (who also has good skin) was raving about how this product heals his blemishes and keeps his skin healthy and clear.  After watching him use the product for several weeks, I noticed a dramatically improved complexion.  His face was simply rejuvinated.		I then decided to take the plunge and try it for myself.  This product was simply amazing.  The four-step process is simple to follow and feels excellent on my face.  My blackheads:  gone.  Any new ones:  gone.  My skin:  clear as can be.		I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking to keep their skin healthy and clean.		A word of caution:  If your face is mild to dry, make sure you use a moisturizer between the morning and evening sessions.  I began to get very dry skin during the first few days, but using the moisturizer helped immensly."

So I only purchase items with a large review community.		It's been a little over two months and this product helps clear my skin, and leaves it feeling very smooth. The only thing I would want different is, if it helped with red blotches. But we cant find all our skin solutions all in one product! lol. It did what what it advertised, and it didn't burn, or make my skin itchy, dry, or flakey. No bad smells either, I know some of you are big on that. Everything feels and smells great.

I am one of those people who have tried NUMEROUS acne products, from over the counter to prescription with no results. I have not yet tried Proactiv because I don't want to shell out the money for a membership without knowing how it will work for me. I tired this product because it was a little cheaper and didn't require a membership. I love it! I don't have ""severe"" acne like what is seen in the Proactiv ""before and after"" commercials, but do get regular breakouts. I have noticed with this product that my face cleared up nicely. However, I tend to get the large, painful cyst-like pimples under the skin that never go away. Normally it takes about two weeks for one of these to clear up (with or without treatment). While using this product, one of these cysts popped up on Sunday, by Tuesday (today) it is nearly gone!		This product seems to be more of a retroactive treatment than preventative, because I am still getting a pimple or blemish here and there, but it clears them up quickly.		Also, this product dries out my skin a bit. So after I apply the stages and let each dry, I apply a layer of Cetaphil facial moisturizer which has SPF and won't clog pores.		All in all a decent product just wish it didn't dry my face out and wish it prevented acne, not just cleared it up."

I'm really happy with this product. I can honestly say that I noticed a difference in a few days with the acnefree than I did in months with Proactiv.

I've had this product for almost two month now and I must say it works wonders with oily skin, it has gotten my oil under control and it has helped with my blackheads, although they are not completely gone. My big cyst-like pimples are non-existent now, and my pore size seems to have minimized which is great!		I was VERY tempted to stop using this product during my first week of use because my skin dried out SOOO much it was ridiculous, my entire face felt like SANDPAPER and LOOKED LIKE SANDPAPER-- no kidding! but I continued and the dead skin soon just went away, but it also caused my skin to itch (this only happened during my sandpaper phase). After using the kit for two weeks straight I decided to slow down on the use and began to alternate steps 3 and 4 each night. Normally you are supposed to use step 3 during the day and step 4 at night but since my acne is under control I decided to use the medications only at night (alternating each night) but I still continue to use the face wash twice a day and always follow with the toner. I found this routine to work great.		Also its recommeded to use sunscreen during the day... I found the BEST suncreen for oily, acne-prone skin ""Neutrogena Clear Skin Sunblock Lotion SPF 55.""

I'm 27, so some acne products currently on the market don't work very well for me.  It has been about 11 days since i've begun using this product and I have noticed a huge difference.  I'd say the only issue I had at first was dry, flaky skin.  It was pretty bad.  I usually supplement other non-comodogenic lotion (CeraVe Lotion) + Jojoba oil after applying the lotion that is provided in this kit.  Problem solved.

If you go in the sun, you can't use it....well, is that to say that you have to live in the deep caves under earth, who never goes in the sun? Also, despite using it anyway (and during the winter so there was no issue of sun) the first time I used it my skin began to smooth but not without an intense and dangerous burning of my skin, I mean 911 burning and my skin dried so much that I had to use healing ointments to soothe it. Then, I shelfed it for a while because I couldn't take it but decided that upon my reuse of it, I would not use the entire system mixed because it's too intense; I opted to use the wash and only the on the spot treatment and it did not do anything for the acne whatsoever!! So I switched out and used the wash with the lotion that comes in the set with the wash (the spot treatment is bought seperately by the way).....still no results.		Then I actually noticed that my skin was having more of a breakout than what I had to begin with; keep in mind that I don't have major or even consistent acne issues.

So i just used STEP 1 after then STEP 3 (high amount). I especially used 1 hour before when i go to sleep. It dries in up to 30 minutes. So you wouldnt wipe it off on your pillow when you at sleep.	Soon i purchased ACNEFREE GREEN TEA MOISTURIZER, i m using it now though.	THIS IS JUST MY DIRECTION THOUGH.	STEP 4 direction was ""only apply at morning"" - but you cant apply at morning because this treatment lotion is too white and doesnt absorbs quickly as like Proactiv STEP 3.		I just want to tell those who gave 1 star on feedback:	JUST USE STEP 1,2,3 , few days later step 2 will finishes (i mean it will run off) then just use STEP 1 and 3, 8.10 am MORNING step 1, very little amount of STEP 3, THEN evening 7 pm when i came back from my work JUST STEP 1, BEFORE SLEEP 11 or 12 pm STEP 1 with HIGH AMOUNT OF STEP 3. THEN WAIT FOR 30 minutes. DRY OFF. SLEEP. (I'm using step 4 once a week, not every night)	STEP 4 IS JUST FOR FIXING THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE FROM STEP 3. Use it when you needed.

No lie- today his face has noticeably fewer whiteheads and is less oily. His skin does not appear irritated and he did not complain of any burning with it's use. I learned that one of the recommended treatments by dermatologists is to use Retin A, which is a primary ingredient (retinol) in the Acne Free Severe Treatment.

I mean clear. During the first three days your skin is very dry- I would suggest a light oil free moisturizer with sunscreen after the regimen, in the morning only. The first use (at night) did cause minor facial swelling that subsided in about the time it took me to shower. As with anything new some adjustment is required- your skin is the largest organ in the body! Some suggestions that I have found to help		1. Wash hands frequently-the oils from our hands feed growing pimples. If you can't wash your hands frequently use a alcohol based sanitizer, this will help minimize the oil in your fingertips.	2.Try not to touch your face, especially during the first week of treatment as this will irritate the obstructions.	3.Before washing your face, take a hot washcloth and drape it over your face (this will open the pores) for about a minute. Then apply the face wash, let the skin dry before applying the toner. Again let the skin dry before applying the repairing lotion. At night, is is very important to wait 10 minutes before applying the night serum-wash your hands again before the last step at night as 10 minutes is enough time for your fingers to build up oils and you will be touching your face again. I hope this helps, and good luck to clear skin."

I definitely recommend this product.  But, as I said, you need to make it part of your healthy lifestyle for the best results."
B000KK53L6,2007,3,5.0,3,3,184,"This product really works.","I have tried it all and this is the only product that has worked for me.  I came across Acnefree while traveling through the U.S. last November and I have to say it is the best investment I ever made for my skin.		I normally don't have the patience for a beauty regime that involves more than a couple of products so when I saw 4 items in the package I was skepticle whether I would stick to following the routine.  It really is very simple to use and doesn't take more than a few minutes to apply after the skin has been cleansed.		I would say within a couple of days after commencing use of the products my breakouts were reduced to almost nil and shortly thereafter the problem was completely cleared.  My skin is still somewhat oily by the end of the day but my pores no longer get blocked.		Thank you University Medical for making a product that actually delivers on its promise, is very reasonably priced and has given me the beautiful complexion I have tried for years to attain."
B000KK53L6,2012,1,4.0,3,3,212,"I've used it for about a year","I've used it for about a year. It's the only product that's completely cleared my face up. I never even considered myself having severe acne, but I always had something or other in some place or another. Everything I tried never got rid of *all* of it.		What I don't like? It's four steps. Thats a lot of time, many nights I forget to use the last step (to use 10 mins after the toner). I'm not very consistent with using it, which is probably why other things never really worked that well. But it cleared up my acne, if I become too inconstant (not using it at least once a day) acne will pop back up. If I start using it consistently again the acne will clear up pretty fast.		I always considered my skin normal, not very oily or dry. My skin never became very dry because of this product. If my skin ever becomes very dry though, I'm pretty quick to apply another lotion to it.		Over all though, it works. It works really good. Even when I say screw it and don't follows all of it's rules is still works pretty well. Not prefect, if you don't do everything, but still better than the rest if your inconsistent."
B000KK53L6,2011,0,4.0,3,3,590,"So far, so good","I have only been using Acne Free Severe for a few days.  I have used the original Acne Free product for the past year or so.  I had run out of the original and went to my local Walmart to pick some up.  They only had the Acne Free Severe product.  It was late, I was tired and decided I would try this.  My acne is far from severe, but I was desperate.  So far, it works better than the original.  I am very cautious about how I use this, and the original product, on my face since my skin is quite sensitive.  This is the only brand I have been able to find that works for me...even ProActive wouldn't work for me.  The AcneFree Severe comes with the same 3 step bottles as the orginal (step 1: cleans, step 2: tone, step 3: repairing lotion) but comes with an addition step, step 4: Retinol Renewal Complex.  I have not tried step 4.  I would much rather have the AcneFree Terminator blemish cream than the Retinol Renewal Complex.  The terminator with the 3 steps seems to work best with my skin.  Is there a bit of burning, itching and irritation?  I won't lie...yes there is.  I have not noticed any drying with the severe though, which with my sensitive skin, surprises me; however(!), I read the directions and ingredients very VERY closely.  When I first started using the original AcneFree, I did all 3 steps every morning and every night...and my face was red, irritated and dry.  The thing is, I found out WHY my face was acting this way.  Yes there is going to be a bit of red, burning/itching irriation because it's the medicine WORKING, and IMO is barable.  The one that I found unbearable was the drying.  What a lot of people don't realize (and I was one of them) is the drying is coming from the lotion.  It's got Benzoyl Peroxide in it, which is the reason your skin is drying out.  ""But the bottle says to use it every morning and night"" &lt;--this is where I think a lot of people make their mistake.  Yes the bottle says this, but it also says if drying and irritation occur to reduce to once a day, which I did.  I only use the repairing lotion at night, and within a few days the drying went away and I now have very soft skin.  So whether you are using the Severe, Original, or Sensitive AcneFree, make sure you are not overdoing the lotion because this is your culprit to the skin dryness.  I use Step1 and 2 twice a day along eith the Terminator Belmish Spot Cream (which you may have to buy separately for like $5, but if you're lucky and look around sometimes you can find it added on to the kit as a ""bonus"", but beware...they do up the price on the kits with the added bonus). The AcneFree Severe started working in one night.  I had a blemish on my chin that appeared the day before I bought the kit and after only 1 night and 1 morning of using it, it has gone down significantly (makeup wouldn't cover it the first day I got the blemish, the day after I started using the Severe kit, makeup covered it beautifully).  So would I recommend it to others?  Yes, but use it diligently (especially the Severe), and remember what I mentioned about the lotion (use only once a day, not twice like the bottle suggests)."
B000KK53L6,2011,3,5.0,1,1,151,"This is great!  I have to give it a thumbs up!","I believe I have found a GREAT product for my stubborn acne!  Finally a product that will not miss a single acne.  I've tried many acne products in the past even the ones talked about on T.V.  The past acne systems I've used would always leave one or two acne bumps behind and I hated that because I thought they were supposed to keep my skin completely clear!  Well I'm happy to say that AcneFree Severe has done and is continuing to do an amazing job!  I love it!  I can purchase it whenever I want without having to buy it every 3 months or so like other products.  It really does get the job done.  I love it.  I am oily skin type with moderate acne.  And walking out with a clean and clear face definitely brings my confidence level up.  I'm amazed with this product, I truly am!  :D"
B000KK53L6,2011,3,2.0,1,1,121,"not sure about this one","So Ive been using this for about three weeks and I havent really seen a change in my face. I have bad acne that comes and goes and when I got this in at the time my face was pretty bad broken out. Though I havent gotten any new brakeouts the ones I already had really havent gotten much better. Im still using it hoping that it might take a few weeks for it to really kick in but I really dont have a whole like ot faith in it now. Oh and whatever you do dont get it near your eyes. I got it just under my eyes and that part of my face was on fire for two days!"
B000KK53L6,2011,3,5.0,1,1,105,"first product that EVER made me say ...WOW","I have tried Proactiv. I have been on birth control. I had just made an appointment to go see a doctor because of my scne. I am 24 and I have NEVER had acne so bad. I am in medical school so I thought, well it is stress. I also get bad cystic acne with my period. When I tried this yesterday I thought...well maybe it will help a little. I woke up this morning and literally said WOW when I looked in the mirror. Yes some little bumps are still there, but compared to what was...O M G all I can say is WOW!"
B000KK53L6,2011,0,5.0,1,1,183,"Great For Mild-Moderate Acne","I have only been using this product for about a week and I have seen an amazing improvement. Overall, it is a great product and if you have mild or moderate acne I would highly recommend this.		I never had an acne problem until I came to college, and the last 6 months have been a struggle with acne. I used the original 3-step Acnefree since middle school and it worked fine all through high school too, I always had a clear face.		When I went to college I got horrible acne (in my opinion, it was probably considered mild or mild-moderate). Anyways I always had acne and I just couldn't do anything about it. Finally I just decided to get the Acnefree severe, even though I technically didn't have severe acne. I was hesitant at first because people said it burned your face and is only for people with severe acne. However, I have not experienced these issues and my face is completely clear. It is slightly drying, but just use a good moisturizer once a day and you will be fine."
B000KK53L6,2011,0,4.0,1,1,130,"Not perfect by itself but... the best I've found","First of all, as other reviews have mentioned this product is much better than proactive. You will see results with this quickly but it's not the silver bullet for acne issues. I used this for about two months and saw a noticable improvement but my skin was still not where I wanted it to be.		With that said, this product in combination with Clarisonic did absolute miracles for me. My skin looks the best it has ever looked in my entire life. If you are using this product and looking for something else to get your skin that extra mile (consistantly), invest in a Clarisonic.		Pros:	Price	Availability	It WORKS		Cons:	Time consuming	Need to be consistant	Not perfect on it's own	May be too strong for some peoples skin"
B000KK53L6,2011,0,5.0,1,1,599,"It works for me!","First off, this is my mother's account. I am an 18 year old male who has a history of bad acne because of genetics. Before using Severe Acne Free, I used to go to a dermatologist because of never ending acne. I'm very happy to say that this Severe Acne Free System definitely works, my skin is clearer than ever. I was going to a dermatologist monthly for less than a year but it became to pricey with the expensive doryx pills, various topical creams [epiduo gel then atralin] and glycolic acid face wash. After putting my dermatologist visits on hold because of the expenses, my acne did not fail to come back. It came back and it felt worse and more of a hassle. I tried all the tools for acne I had including Proactiv and leftovers from the derma but nothing was really clearing up my acne. Over my winter break, it got really bad. Didn't feel like going out in public anymore. Acne, pimples that resembled cysts, dry raw skin, black/white heads...the worst. My mom read reviews for Severe Acne Free and was convinced it would help, so we found a set at Walmart for $21.87. I used it and the steps were similar to Proactiv. There are 3 steps for the morning and 4 at night. I used the 4 steps when I first got it and the next morning my face felt smoother and the right side of my face looked almost clear. I was amazed at how fast it worked because of the severity of my acne the day before. I got and used Severe Acne Free System on 12/30 [evening treatment] and it's 1/3 right now and my face has diminishing pimples on my cheeks and is not dried up nor feeling greasy but for the most part my face is pretty cleared up in only 5 days. I feel that its secret is the 4th step that you apply at night which Proactiv didn't have. It really gets at any pimples that are already there and any pimples that are just starting to form. I conclude with this-I went to a dermatologist, the results started happening within a month. Severe Acne Free results happened the next day for me. Huge price difference. All there is to say is that it works!		This is his mom now...for over the counter product, this is excellent! No, we're not being paid to recommend this product or write this. We're just sharing our experience. My son's face isn't completely cleared of blemishes yet but for him it's a major improvement. He's happy that those gigantic red cysts had gone down a lot. He just has to keep at it...To compare a $21.87 product to his derma treatment, here's the breakdown: his monthly doctor's visits [$160 each visit], prescription oral pills [Doryx] cost $421/30 pills/month, glycolic acid face wash cost $25 [lasted about 3 months] sold at the derma's office and his 2 topical gel/cream [epiduo and atralin]cost >$100/tube....no wonder our Aetna's health fund was consumed in 7 months. We started paying our other medical expenses after that in full from our own pockets because we haven't fulfilled our deductible for the year....Bottomline, this works and my son is back to going out in public with us or his friends without hiding his face in a hoodie all the time! Give it a try, it might work for you.....Oh, 1 last note, use a white or cream colored towel and be sure that you'd be wearing a sleepwear you don't mind being damaged by benzoyl peroxide..."
B000KK53L6,2010,11,5.0,1,1,123,Works!!,"This stuff worked wonders for my skin. I was taking a supplement called Vitex and it caused my skin to go from breaking out 1-2 times a week to breaking out 2-3 times a DAY!!!! My skin was in a horrible condition and everything I tried was just making it worse, not better.		I finally decided to try AcneFree Severe and I'm glad I did. I saw results in just a few days!! It did take about a 6 weeks to totally clear up my skin but the point is it worked almost immediately and kept improving my skin (which is now back to normal).		Some people do not respond to Benzoyl Peroxide, but for those that do this is a great product!!"
B000KK53L6,2010,9,5.0,1,1,286,"Wow this stuff works.","Let me give a super brief background about myself. YAZ birthcontrol and Bare Minerals destroyed my face: cystic acne, red crusty, flaky, oily, disgusting. It was horrible time in my life, super embarrassing.I have always had moderate to severe acne, from High school til now- I'm 23 years old. I have tried: antibiotics/differn, clean and clear & clear advantage acne kit, clearasil ulta acnes solution kit,lush,and OF COURSE PROACTIVE, which sucks the most by the way.  Then I found Acne Free Severe Treatment. Simply the best and within 10 days a major improvement. However within those first 10 days it can be a scary process. The first 1-5 days more pimples came out from the woodwork, there were all over my face! But I still religiously did all the steps and by the 10th day, my skin was clearer! All but one pimple was left. My skin feels soft and clean.		Most reviews says it dries out your face, my face is was super oily so it didn't start to feel dry until the 7th day. Now I incorporate oil free moisturizer in the morning. Once a week i also use a exfoliant, if its needed.		BUY A WHITE TOWEL, Benzoyl peroxide will destroy you'r towels, but its worth it. :]	AVOID the eye area. Thin skin beneath my eyes became a bit flaky but now i just avoid the eyes: problem solved.		first i wet my face do step 1	dry my face do step 2	brush teeth, you want your face completely dry from the toner before proceeding to step 3	once face is completely dry do step 3		wait an hour or right before i leave for school/work i put on my moisturizer"
B000KK53L6,2010,9,5.0,1,1,393,"Stop wasting your time!!!","Seriously - Stop wasting your time on BS products.  If you've landed on this page, you are fortunate.  This product outperforms every single product and DOCTOR I have talked to about my skin.  I didn't develop acne until the ripe age of 26. YES, 26!!!! WTH, right??  At least I only had to deal with one awkward phase of life at a time, not all at the age of 16 -- so anyways, I tried everything until I noticed my sister's skin had cleared entirely after using this product.  She doesn't even need to wear face make up anymore. Yes, it cleared up that much.  I decided to give it a whirl ... I mean why not, I had already spent so much money on other products, what's another 25 bucks right?  Hands down, the best $25 dollars I ever spent.  I got my glow back, my self esteem, my energy... all for less than an hour's work.  I couldn't be more happy with my skin, it's even better now than it was before I started breaking out.  I barely wear any face make up, just some powder and blush and it looks so smooth.		The only qualm I have is the process.  You have to be dedicated and go in with the mindset that this is a 3 stop process and it does take time.  It's not just washing your face and slick on some moisturizer.  It is really CLEANING your face with the face wash, using the toner.  Letting that dry entirely and then either putting on the moisturizer in the morning, or the overnight cream at night.  This should be put on very generously.  I've noticed the more I put on, the clearer my skin is in the morning.  This also has to dry before hitting the pillow to avoid a mess.		Also, as another reviewer wrote, this is not for you if you have the rare breakout.  The medicines are potent and it will dry out your skin the first week you use it.  Keep lip balm handy as it dries out your lips too.  This only lasts about the first week or two though and after that you'll be glad you stuck to it.  Also, keep out of your eyes -- don't even get close because it will irritate your undereyes as well. I speak from experience :/"
B000KK53L6,2010,6,5.0,1,1,149,"I Love this Product!","This product is unbelievable! My son is 15 years old, African American, and had a severe case of acne on both sides of his face and on his forehead. We tried numerous creams, cleansers, soaps, and home remedies found on the Internet. Nothing worked! Finally in desperation, I bought this product because I thought it was ""Proactiv""; I misread read the advertising slogan as the product title. When I realized my mistake, I started to return it to the store, but decided to see if there were any online reviews. Since everyone was raving about it, we decided to give it a try. It's been two weeks and the acne is completely gone. Everyday you could see improvement: first the pimples diminished, then the black scarring started to fade, and now it's as if he never had acne. I don't know if ""Proactiv"" works, but ""AcneFree Severe"" definitely does!"
B000KK53L6,2012,2,1.0,1,2,182,"Awful for skin!!!!!! Does not work!","Do NOT waste your money on this! I am 28 years old and have always had oily/problem skin. The benzoyl peroxide in the face wash and ""day cream"" burn and sting when you apply. Also you can't realistically apply the day cream during the day as it leaves a messy white residue on your face. My face never felt clean using this product and I continued to break out. I would use the spot treatment on existing treatments and I would have to say that is the only semi good product they offer: it dries up an existing pimple faster as opposed to using nothing at all. If you expect this to stop your acne it won't, benzoyle peroxide is awful for yous skin and known to cause thin skin and premature aging. As a side note I have started using Lerosett, an organic clay mask/face wash skin care line and let me tell you it is amazing! I have cystic acne and it works. If you are looking for something on the cheaper side try Aztec healing clay, does wonders. :)"

I got the 4 piece sensitive skin + the Mask at a Proactiv kiosk at the mall and it was $80.00.	I needed to find something I can afford! I read all the reviews for skin care and AcneFree Severe kept coming up.  I gave it a try and  within a week it cleared my face!!! Even the Skin Dr products were not that fast!!

I thought I would give this product a try and sure enough, it has been amazing.

I stopped using the product since now my skin gets real tight on my face after water hits it, and i dry it, and my skin on my face is getting red and burns when i rub any  wash cloth.

B000KK53L6,2011,0,4.0,0,0,340,:),"Well I can finally say Ive found something that works. Ive had mild to severe acne since 13 and Im 27 now. My acne would come and go but I could never find anything that kept it from coming back. I was alway looking for stuff that reacted to the acne and not to prevent it. I have sensitive skin so anything I use has to be mild, non irritating and not greasy. I saw the reviews on amazon but I was so fed up that I just went to another store to buy it instead of waiting for it to be delivered. I was concerned about the benzyl peroxide because of my sensitive skin and let me say my concerns were justified. At first my skin started to turn red and dry out on my forehead and near my chin. I counter acted this with stopping the treatment for two days and used a good moisturizer. This got my skin back to normal with minimal acne present. I really like that they include the retinol for use at night. If you are not familiar with retinol do some research on it. It has shown to reduce winkles and make skin look younger but also it helps with preventing acne. Im not sure of the quality of the Vitamin A in the retinol cause the package is only 20 and some retinol can be pretty pricey for quality stuff but I must say it works. The benzyl peroxide repair lotion is nice not only cause it puts moisture it but also works to prevent acne from forming in the day. Now if you work in an environment where you sweat be careful cause benzyl peroxide will stain clothes. Also, be sure to wash your face of the benzyl peroxide lotion before bed cause you might stain your pillows. So far Im pretty happy with the results and I will continue to use this product. If it stops working I will try to remember to come back and update this review."

My skin tends to get dry if I use it twice daily for days on end, so I use it once daily. I did try to use regular AcneFree but it didn't work as well.

I came across this product and believe it or not this was like last Acne Medicine that I hadn't tried from CVS pharmacy and I thought well it's not going to help anyways and I gave up already and just accepted the fact that my face wouldn't be as it used to. Sounds familiar? First week, OMG First week and it's all gone. I couldn't believe it. I've been using this product for a month now and been following all the directions and using it 2 times daily and I've had some acne scars, they are clearing up too ! This product gave me confidence I had and took all that frustration out of my life, now I can look in the mirror and see myself again and not the acne infested face. I've been following healthy diet and trying to avoid acne causing foods as much as I could and it worked. All of it's said there are some downsides too. First of, these medications are very potent and my left eye been itching since I started using this product because I think I accidentally applied some around my eye. Other than that I'm so glad I tried this product and would recommend to anyone with moderate - severe acne. I would also recommend you putting aloe gel on your face because it really soothes and makes the redness and irritation go away."

I honestly picked it out of all the products because it was in a bright package and on sale. I am very glad their marketing worked! I tried proactive (worked for a month then just started to dry and deteriorate my skin) and Nutregena, I even saw a dermatologist and was given prescription strength medications lotions and even birth control for acne. None of it worked nearly as well as this. It has even started to get rid of some of the scars that past acne break outs left.  I wish I had one of those before and after pictures. I encourage people to give this product a try."

B000KK53L6,2012,7,4.0,0,0,393,"Significant Improvement In My Skin!","I waited 6-8 weeks before reviewing this product because I wanted to give it the entire chance before deciding if it was working or not. (The product states it may take up to 8 weeks to work fully for severe acne.) I used the product diligently, twice a day as directed, all steps. I would consider myself having moderate to severe acne -- usually peaking during PMS and less severe during the rest of the month. I am 31 years old and have had acne since a teenager. I took accutane in my early 20s but I think hormones continue to get the best of my face and it reappeared a few years later. I used Proactiv previously which seemed to help at first but quickly lost its vigor and I felt like the only thing it was good for was bleaching my towels.		So I run across Acne Free which seemed to have pretty good reviews & thought it was worth a try. I started the product during PMS (which may or may not have been a good idea). I consider myself to have sensitive skin but didn't have any problems with this product itching, peeling, redness or anything. Maybe my skin was previously conditioned by the Proactiv but it was fine nonetheless. Here is a warning for people who actually have pretty bad skin: the first week, my skin was a nightmare. It reminded me of my teenage days when I would have 8-10 (or more) pimples at a time - rather than my usual 4-5 during PMS. However, I actually felt like it was doing something: purging the impurities, bringing it all to the surface - unlike Proactiv. After about a week and a half of madness, things started to clear up like magic. I had a blissful period of 3 weeks with nary a pimple. Then PMS rolled around again & the breakout began -- but much, much less severe.  For the weeks following, I would say that I have experienced about 1 pimple per week on average. The pimples that I do get are much smaller, surface quickly and go away quickly. There has been a significant improvement in my skin.		Overall, I'm pretty happy with the product because I have seen an overall improvement in my skin and I believe it's probably the best product out there."

I started getting dark spots all over my face for picking at my pimples. I tried over the counter treatments i tried spot treatments and though they they vanish SOME pimples more and more and more just kept appearing i was extremely depressed . I decided to try this product!!!!!!!! At first i noticed a difference i was breaking out alot less my pimples would dry out and eventually leave. BUT my skin gets tooooooooooooooooo oily. Its disgusting. I dont know why but instead of over drying like some people says it does it just makes my face ao greasy though my face is clearing up having greasy face is so embarrassing and makes my face look so unhealthy idk what to do. Im afraid if i stop using this product my breakouts will begin again but i need to keep this oil under control. I reccommend this product to people who do not have such oily skin, it works!!!!

B000KK53L6,2012,6,5.0,0,0,387,"works well with other products","I'm 43, female, have had mild cystic acne off and on for 17 years, and in the last few years my go-to remedies (antibiotics and Retin-A) completely stopped working. Two months ago, my acne was getting so bad that I didn't want to leave the house. Since no ""one"" product had ever worked, I decided to try three products together, and 4 weeks later, my acne is gone. Here are the three products: Yogi Skin DeTox Tea, Acne Free Maximum Strength, and the 0.5mm MT Skin Roller. It took a full 4 weeks to get consistently clear skin. I did get one bump around the two week mark, and I had some old bumps that took a full 4 weeks to clear up. Here's what to do:		1. Drink two cups of Skin DeTox tea daily.(Tastes great hot or cold.)	2.Use the Maximum Strength Acne Free system morning and night.	3. At night, use the MT Roller once a week all over your face over the Acne Free Retinol Complex. Apply a little extra Retinol Complex to problem areas after rolling.	4. At night, use the MT Roller over the Retinol Complex every other day between weekly rollings ONLY on problem areas. You can stop doing this once the problems clear up, or roll only when problems surface.	5. After the first four weeks, continue to use the roller weekly with the Retinol Complex or other products to remove old acne scars.	6. Use a 15-30 spf sunscreen daily. The roller and Retinol Complex will increase sun sensitivity.		 I used the DeTox tea and Acne Free products for two weeks without rolling, and I saw improvements to my skin tone and texture right away, but the deep cysts remained. It wasn't until I started rolling with the MT Roller that the cysts started shrinking or came to the surface of the skin.		I hope this works for other people, particularly people over 40. The MT Roller will be too harsh on 20-something skin. Go easy with the roller if you are under 40 and roll less frequently. Keep a sanitary environment when rolling and clean your roller afterward. Don't roll on broken skin or white pustules. See other websites on how to use and clean your roller. I soak mine in alcohol for 15 minutes after rolling."

Hence I thought I need to use a complete system to cleanse, tone and treat my skin. after using this product my chin and cheeks are full of acne.  I don't know where I went wrong.  My skin was super itchy and dry in the first two weeks. I accidently applied it around my eyes and next morning my eyelids were swollen up.  My skin feels like its burning when I apply this product.  If it cleard my acne I would continue to apply the product to the affected areas. but instead I have more acne.  So I just bought a local brand acne cream which has 10% benzoyl peroxide."

I wish I'd have bought the Pro Active...$20 down the toilet. My acne has gotten worse the first week of using this product. Anyone wanna buy it for $10? I barely used it, but I forgot to mention how unsettling it was to open a box with a little tab of tape at each end and no seals on the tubes and the under the lid foil on step 4 was part way open and there was no foil under the other three lids.

Everyone's skin is different, so you may need to try several products to find something that really works for you.  However, I highly recommend trying AcneFree Severe before purchasing Proactive.

My doctor has prescribed oral antibiotics which did show some improvement but not for a good stretch of time. AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment has shown tremendous progress over the course of a couple months of faithful use. While it wasn't as miraculous as I had hoped in terms of speed of improvement, after a significant amount of use, I'm finding far less breakouts occurring and the ones that do crop up disappear quicker. I don't see myself switching to any other acne treatments as the results I've seen here have been unparalleled by anything else I've used (that's Proactiv included).

The next day, i could tell that this product went straight to work.

It did dry my skin, but I used a facial lotion with a sunscreen on top of this treatment program. And honestly I'd rather have dry, clear skin than oily acne skin.  I can finally leave my house without make up on and not feel like everyone is staring at me.  This product was very worth the money spent. I'd encourage anyone to at least try it."

What I can tell you is that I have been using it for approx. three months faithfully, only to find that the most it did was transfer my acne colonies in a different direction. Yes, that's right--when one colony disappeared, another appeared just slightly n/s/w/e from the original position. It was very frustrating; I resorted to sleeping in different positions and other potentially helpful measures, but to no avail. Here are the specs of my skin:		1. I have extremely dry skin	2. I have extremely NON-sensitive skin	3. I have acne just about everywhere	4. I rarely go out in the sun	5.

I normally never get cystic acne.  Once and a while I will get a cyst.  But not 5 at once!		Like all topical treatments, the results are only temporary.  I am starting to believe that acne's real root cause is chronic inflammation.  I am going to try to cure my acne with the anti inflammatory diet.		Anyways, back to this product.  The first week the cysts all went away.  The red marks are still there.  As expected my face went through drying and peeling fits.  The skin that dried up would peel away on it's own.  At one point I had no active zits.  Then today I got some new ones...  So I am not sure if I want to stay on these harsh chemicals any longer.

I typed them directly off of the bottles/tube.  But I may have typed some wrong.  I was rushing.

Part of the bottle of the wash comes off while you are trying to get it out sometimes.  This is annoying because you have to try to get the product back in and then push the part back in.  It's weird... Anyways... yeah. :P		I just have to say, after typing all the ingredients I am exhausted.  I just thought everyone has the right to know what is in this stuff.  It is sometimes hard to find the ingredients of products that are for your skin.  They should be readily available and up to date by everyone who sells them... :		And one more point...  If something like beer damages your liver, cigarettes damage your lungs... So the things you put in your body do affect your organs.  Your skin is an organ.  If your liver and kidneys can't properly and efffiently do their jobs of naturally detoxing your blood and body...  Then the skin is called on.  If we throw garbage into our bodies it has to leave somehow.  And garbage over time can do this...  And food can also affect hormones.  Do not take what I am saying to heart.  It is just an idea and thought.  Based on reading of course.  And if you want to take this idea and grow on it, go ahead.  I think cleaning internally has to come first.  Mind and Body must be cleansed and purified before you can get the results maybe...  I will see after I go on this diet. lol  Just thoughts.  Not scientific evidence or nothing.  I have had ance for over 4 years now... Tired of it...  Hmm..  Well comments are appreciated.  Please rant about your acne.  Relieve some stress.  Ranting can be good once and a while. :D		Good luck!  I hope my review can help you decide if this is the product to help your skin for a little while.  But it will not cure your acne, oil production, hormones imbalances, allergies, sensitivities, emotions, nutritional deficiencies, etc.  I think a lot of what acne is about goes on inside and shows on the outside of the skin.  I've seen filthy caked with dirt people before with no acne...  Who knows...		Your opinions are welcome. :  Just don't freak out on me.  This is just an opinionated/what I have read kinda review.  I simply am throwing my ideas/thoughts out there.  And I am not just throwing an ignorant review out there.  It has some thought put into it.

I thought it would go away but it ended up being a burn on my my neck. I stopped using the product and after a week the burn mark went away.

It is extremely potent and after 5 days of use my skin's texture has completely changes and not for the better! My skin feels coarse, dry, and flaky.		I wouldn't recommend for mild acne, I would try something a little less extreme. I'm going back to exposed skin care. I will keep you posted!"
B000KK53L6,2013,1,1.0,0,0,260,"Ugh don't","I used this for three months. I was better off before, actually. I have constant breakouts.  I would get really strange pimples the likes of which I've never seen, using this stuff. I got a bunch of cysts, which would get very infected.		Maybe you should just go to a dermatologist.		Also, benzoyl peroxide should just be used as a spot treatment. Not a lotion. Or else you will prematurely age your skin and it will look like an orange. And you will still have pimples.  But if you have so many pimples, maybe the lotion makes sense. Only, this product doesn't work for everyone.  (I would say I'm an 8 out of 10, as far as ""severity"" goes, with 10 being the most severe acne.)		What is actually helping is this:		Wash your face with oatmeal. Just raw oatmeal.	Change your sheets.	Scrub with baking soda.	I know you're going to pick at your face, but try not to. If you're going to, then first try applying a heated spoon to your zit. (Don't burn yourself.)  Then apply lemon juice.  This shrinks your pores as well.	Leave used teabags on your zits.	Eat lots of coconut oil.	Put coconut oil on your face at night.		Mess around with these things until you find a combo that's right for you. Your skin looks better, like, instantly, and it just keeps getting better. But be careful because all that scrubbing can irritate your skin.  I'm still not 100% clear, but people compliment me on my skin.		Or, just see a dermatologist."

I've tried it all - dermatologist cream perscriptions, proactive and all the other products that you see in the stores.  I found what worked best for me was to purchase the strongest products I could find in the stores, but it never REALLY cleared up my skin.		Until a few months ago when I decided to try the AcneFree Severe system.  My skin is almost completely clear now!  I do still get the occasional break out, but my skin is 10X better than it has EVER been.  Any pimples that I do get are typically smaller and go away faster than they used to.  This stuff is awesome - it actually works!		A couple warnings and tips:	-AcneFree Severe is strong and it will dry out most peoples skin.  I have very oily skin, but this product has helped dry out my skin greatly!	-AVOID the eye area, as that skin is extra sensitive and dries out easily.	-Invest is a good moisturizer!!  Use it wherever you skin gets dry.  I usually only have to use it around my eyes, and sometimes on my neck.	-If you wear makeup, use a make-up removing wash (non-acne-medicated) first, then wash with the acnefree cleanser.  I found that the acnefree cleanser doesn't remove makeup without using a LOT of it.  So, wash the makeup off with a make-up removing cleanser first, then use the AcneFree system.

B000KK53L6,2009,9,5.0,2,2,242,"it really works!","i am a 22 year old female and i thought i was finally done with breakouts. my skin was clear for a few years with an occasional pimple here and there that i would zap with acne spot treatment medication. however, after i started my new job, i was under a lot more stress. i started breaking out with big, painful red pimples and as soon as one would finally go away another would pop up. i was so frustrated and i hated what i saw when i looked in the mirror. i decided to pick up the acnefree severe kit from my local cvs store and thought, what the heck? after just 3 days i noticed a difference. a pimple i had on the side of my nose cleared up overnight and my skin really started to look better. i am so happy with this product. the only downsides are it made the skin around my eyes very tight so i made sure to moisturize them all throughout the day. other than that, this product is a godsend. i tried proactive a few years ago and my acne never cleared up so i stopped and just used the basic drugstore products which worked fine. however, acnefree definitely helped alleviate my stress-caused acne and i am so thankful! i would recommend this to anyone who has tried other products and received no results. acnefree may be just what you're looking for :)"

After several years, I decided a month ago to try AcneFree Severe, simply because it's supposed to work well against stubborn cases.  So far I'm pretty impressed; I started off with worse acne, but things have settled down.  I'm not completely clear, but much better than I was with Proactiv.  It can dry out skin, so I make sure to use a moisturizer, and that eliminates it.		Keep in mind, I'm not saying Proactiv doesn't work--it does for some people, I'm sure.

I saw the acnefree severe product at Target and thought it couldn't hurt to try one more product.  I have to say it has been a miracle.  My face is clear and I haven't had one cystic pimple since.  I will have a little tiny pimple every one in awhile, but that's no big deal since I am used to constant awful break outs.		The product is drying so I cleanse and tone with the acnefree product in the morning and use my own moisturizer and then at night I cleanse, tone, and put the lotion on.  Then the alternating night I cleanse, tone skip the lotion and use the step 4 product.  You are never supposed to use step 3 the lotion and step 4 together.  I don't use their lotion in the am because it feels to gritty under makeup.  The alternating seems to keep my face from drying out too bad. Use moisturizer...it is crucial! The products are staining to materials so be careful what you touch after applying.		I can't tell you how excited I am about this product.  I was about to go on acutane because I was so depressed about my skin.  I have very oily skin so I needed something to keep it under control.

The AcneFree treatment system comes with great products that help your skin. The PH balancing part if this system is amazing and completely changed the the look and feel of my skin! The wash works really well and leaves my face feeling clean without ruining my skin. I you have acne you know how hard it is to find a soap that doesn't undo all the work your treatments are doing. The over night cream is the one step I cut out once in a while. It stops your face from drying out but occasionally leaves my face feeling slightly oily. And, of course, last but not least, the cream. I put this on my entire face, back, and chest every morning. Then I leave it in my purse and use it as a spot treatment if I feel a new breakout attempting to surface during the day. This product truly stops a zit in it's path. I no longer feel helpless when I feel a zit coming.		AcneFree uses Benzoyl Peroxide to treat you acne instead of Salicylic Acid, which is the active ingredient in many if not most of your over the counter acne treatments. I have found this to be very helpful in and of it's self but if you've already tried treatments with benzoyl peroxide I would still say this product is worth a try.		About me and my skin: I'm 22 I did not have a lot of acne in high school but in college I started breaking out all the time. I tried many treatments, with no results.

I didn't.		At 24, getting tired of constantly worrying about my face and piling on makeup to hide it, I decided to give AcneFree Severe a shot. At first, my acne got worse!! I used it exactly as directed for a month and saw no improvement, so was beginning to be once again discouraged.

I decided to use some of my Christmas money to try AcneFree Severe. I am so happy I did!!! I have so much more confidence now... I almost spent $80.00 on the Clinique Acne Solutions and am happy I tried this before hand! In one day, my redness was gone.

My face has been glowing ever since without a pimple anywhere in sight!"
B000KK53L6,2011,7,5.0,14,16,1216,"For Cost Effectiveness, Nothing I've used beats this","*Edit 12/28/2012*		This is a look at my 2 years of experience with AcneFree Severe. I found this product because I was looking for a wallet friendly alternative to controlling acne besides accutane or seeing a dermatologist. I want to help you understand the effects of this product but I'll also talk about my routine and I how I use it.		(STEP 1) The Antibacterial Cleansing Wash		The Antibacterial Wash has Benzoyl peroxide in it which is the standard for fighting acne causing bacteria. Keep this in mind: you are administering a double dose of Benzoyl Peroxide when you use the Antibacterial Wash in combination with the Maximum Strength Repair Lotion in (STEP 3).		The Wash itself feels mild, yet creamy, with some granules. I give my face a gentle rub for a couple minutes and rinse with cool water. With the plausibility of dry skin due to the Benzoyl Peroxide, I DO NOT recommend warm or hot water as it breaks down a very fine layer of epithelial lipids that keep skin balmy and protected.		(STEP 2) The Renewing Toner		The Renewing Toner is definitely a vital component because its primary ingredient is Witch Hazel. It helps balance the facial PH (reducing oil) and hydrate the skin which is subjected to the Benzoyl Peroxide. When putting on the Toner, you should be able to feel the elasticity of your natural skin return and it should ameliorate any dryness or burning with a few swabs applied from a cotton ball. This step should not be ignored.		Witch Hazel is an astringent which can be store bought at any old CVS/Walgreens/Walmart for a few dollars. I am currently experimenting with a bottle to see if there is any noticeable difference between AcneFree's Toner and just a regular bottle of Witch Hazel.		(STEP 3) The Maximum Strength Healing Lotion (Benzoyl Peroxide)		AcneFree has the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide (STEP 3) which is great. 10% is very potent as another reviewer already stated. It does pack a noticeable ""cool burning"" sensation and it does feel a little like sandpaper. If you don't cake it on, it won't dry your skin out. I would know because the skin around my mouth gets creases/laugh lines easily if my skin is dry.		I advise to start with smaller/thinner applications of the Healing Lotion and let your skin adjust over a week. Like I said, the Toner should really be used in conjunction with the lotion. Another great thing about it (for me) is the bottle for the Healing Lotion seems to last really long. I have left overs from 3 boxes ago which I apply on my back and shoulders and chest with great results. Like I said, you don't need to go overboard. If you find yourself just going through bottles, you might be using to much. Twice a day application should help a lot.		STEP 4) The Retinol Complex		This works great to soften and nourish the skin. I recommend using it after your first week of just STEPS 1-3, to get your skin use to the products. I find myself using it at night and in the morning. The Retinol Complex says it is not to be used in tandem with The Healing Potion (10% Benzoyl Peroxide). What I do is I substitute the Retinol Complex for the Healing Potion a couple days a week or when I have been getting exposed to really dirty conditions or harsh elements (e.g. exercise, winter, beach, dog). I do notice it keeps my skin supple and more colorful. I recently found out retinol is basically vitamin A which is crazy good for keeping skin young looking. My face suffers much less dryness and irritability when I apply it. The Retinol cream is viscous, but it blends into the skin very nicely. It is not oily or noticeable.		My Insights		Over the years I have experimented with using The Antibacterial Wash, The Benzoyl Peroxide and the Retinol Complex completely by themselves. I have determined for myself that the while the Antibacterial Wash and Benzoyl Peroxide fight acne, it is the Retinol Complex and the Renewing Toner that will ""stabilize"" your skin. Without The Toner (STEP 2), the potency of The Wash (Step 1) and The Healing Lotion (STEP 3) may dry you out!		The good thing is if you make regular and -light- applications of all the steps, it does well.  The sad thing is, since the Renewing toner is basically like a liquid consistency, not cream, so it runs out faster than the other two steps. The Retinol Complex is also a smaller ""bottle"" so if you use it like the others, you'll run out. I reserve it for night time applications as directed.		I had already tried Proactive and the regular Acnefree. I started SEVERE Acnefree since I had no where else to look in my budget after off brand homeostasis pills and whatnot.		BTW, Proactiv really does suck. I wish I had a box so I could compare active ingredients and topical strengths but I do not. Back when I was in High School it cost a silly price (39.99) and used a lot of celebrity endorsement to gain false credibility (catalogues featuring Vanessa Williams/Jessica Simpson/Avril Lavigne). I used it for a about half a year before ditching it with mediocre results.		Anyway, I'm not sure how they actually measured AcneFree Severe to be 4x better, but YES, it performed INFINITELY better than Proactiv for me. Excellent and cost effective product. It smells slightly but it is not a concern for me. While I gave it 5 out of 5 stars, I CANNOT speak for EVERYBODY's skin. This supposedly niche product has performed very well in both fighting my acne and rejuvenating my skin for a $20 package ($18, now that amazon has the subscribe feature).		One kit will last me about 4-ish months. I presume the average/new user may consume it in about 2-3 months. I have learned how much my skin needs and how to effectively apply my products overtime. That will take some practice on your part. The Toner usually empties first but pour about 4-5 drops on a normal size cottonball and it should last closer to the other bottles. Just swab lightly so you can really cover on your face without having to apply more.		-FINISHING REMARKS-		I'm not going to lie, I do get a bump or a pimple here or there. This is not a miracle product, but it does exactly what I was hoping it could do: control my acne, prevent breakouts, and promote skin health. My face is much clearer and I have much more confidence because I know the regime will provide consistent results. I am not""cured"" from acne but I cannot blame this product for that because I have a very active and somewhat stressful lifestyle filled with dirt and irritation. That being said, AcneFree SEVERE is 20 bucks and I'm still using it 2 years after I found it :)		Protip: Wash your pillow sheets often. All those dead hair and skin cells on your face and the rubbing of skin on dirty fabrics? Those will cause breakouts, just FYI.		If you have any questions feel to drop this review a comment I try to stay up to date."
B000KK53L6,2011,2,5.0,7,7,240,"Finally - something worked!!!","I started getting acne in my early 30's. I tried so many acne systems over 9 years (I'm 39 now), including Pro Activ and nothing worked - until now!  I put off adding a review right away (even though I noticed results immediately) because I wanted to be sure I was going to have positive results long term.  I've been using Acne Free Severe for about 6 weeks now and couldn't be happier.  Immediately, it started to heal the pimples I had (large cyst like pimples).  And, it keeps new pimples from appearing.  Before using Acne Free it seemed like each morning, I woke with a new red spot on my face.  I used to run to the mirror as soon as I got up to see what was there, now I am rest assured to only find a clear, smooth face!  Not only did it clear my pimples, but it has really started to repair damage done from pimples I've had in the past. I have experienced NO dryness and no redness!  But, you should only use this if you truly have ""severe"" acne and severely oily skin. I always seem to run out of the toner before the rest of the products.  Saw a you tube video where a customer recommends using witch hazel as toner until the other 3 products run out!  Was glad for that tip and thought I'd share.  I'm so grateful for this product!!!!!!!"
B000KK53L6,2009,5,5.0,6,6,183,"Worked for me in 3 weeks","Since my 20's I've struggled with cystic acne (I'm now 48), with bouts of one to two cysts at any given time.  Usually one is healing while a new one is forming.  They are painful, disfiguring and slow to heal.  Took 2 rounds of Accutane which was supposed to cure me, but didn't.  I've developed my own ""surgical"" intervention when possible, but the cyst has to follow a specific pattern to open with a sterile needle.  If all else fails I go to the dermatologist for a steroid shot.  For some reason, I've gone through a worse episode than normal so I bought AcneFree on 5/21  I'm four weeks in and this last week my face has begun to clear - no new cysts and the old ones healing more quickly than usual.  In addition, the quality of my skin is improving.  I'm also pleased that I've not experienced extreme dryness as others report.  So far I am a happy customer.		July 28th, 2009 update - still no new blemishes.  Face is clear for the 1st time in months.  Still a happy customer."
B000KK53L6,2007,8,5.0,50,67,124,"African American woman's review.  Thumbs up!!!","I only started breaking out with acne in my early thirties.  After trying the Loreal adult acne system for 2 months & Proactiv for 6 months with minimal results, I decided to give this a try.  Yes, it made my skin very dry the first few weeks but I used a moisturizer over it kept using it and got fantastic results.  I had the hard, large painful nodules on my face and this not only cleared them but I don't even break out anymore.  One kit lasted me 6 months and my skin is soft & smooth.  After the acne went it away, it did leave behind the black marks but Avon's skin brightener faded those out almost overnight.  I highly recommend this product."
B000KK53L6,2010,8,5.0,13,16,664,"The best over the counter acne system!","I am 22 and have batteling acne on and off since I was 14. During that time I have tried everythng including Proactiv... which really, dont waste your money! I was basically best friends with my dermatolgist who knew that my skin would need something new every other year, due to its becoming immuned to the medicine after awhile. But after m insurance got cancelled my acne medication prices sky rocketed... so I decided to play the over the counter game till I got insurance again.		I spent a few hours looking up my skin type online... I looked up all the active ingredients of most acne medications and then spent a few hours in CVS reading the packaging over every acne clearing medicine on the shelf. This is the one I settled on seeing that it had the strongest chemicals in a single system than anything else. I bought with it the acnefree sulfur mask and after 2 months bought the acnefree scar fading cream. I also own an exfoliator by St. Ives, a cucumber rejuvenating peel-off mask and use Neutrogena Acne free foundation when I put make up on (it has saylic acid in it, one of the low doses of acne treatment). With this particular combination of things I have been acne free. It is a long a process and my skin needs so many products to stay healthy and not have a break out... but this product really is the best... I noticed it working after 2 weeks.		Here are some tips I have had to find out the hard way about acne breakouts:	1. The number one thing I have to advice girls to do is to start a birth control pill or patch. The moment I stop my acne flares very badly. It takes about 3 months for it to show up on your skin, but its the best way to regulate skin condition.	2. If you get cheeck acne like I do... pay attention to cleaning your cell phone often... or putting it on speaker as often as possible, of just holding it a bit away from your face when you talk.	3. Clean your pillow cases as often as you can! Think about it... your laying with your face and hair smooshed against something for 8 hours at a time.	4. Keep your hair back when ever you cantieing it back and pulling back bangs... just styled your hair and don't want a big rubber band kink in it? Just use a piece of ribbon and pull it back gently till your ready to go out and just use a small bobby pin to pull the bangs. (Not only does your hair lock in oils... but think of all those chemicals you spray in it that rubs off on your face!)	5. Avoid putting on make up till you really need to... I highly highly highly recommend Neutrogenas Liquid Foundation that actually has acne medicine it. You can find it at your local drug store... this is the only kind of make up that dosnt cause a break out of any sort.	6. Touch your face as little as possible during the day.	7. Watch what you eat. Some people say chocolate... but I swear for me its shrimp! But I guess for different people really you can have different reactions... but shrimp will cause a flare up within a day... they are bottom feeders... so I am just eating the dirt that they eat off the bottom of the ocean.	8. Try a skin vitamin! Vit. E, Biotin, and flax will really help skin a lot! Anything with omegas in it makes skin and hair stronger and healthier. I love Avacados!		Those are my tips... I am just a normal person who has been very observant of my skin and have made coorelations between breakouts and the things I have done... it dosn't hurt to make your own diary and mark your own findings. :)"
B000KK53L6,2010,2,5.0,5,5,231,"so far so good","I've been only using this product for a week now and it seems to be working well. I'm nervous to get too optimistic because products tend to work for a while and then stop on me. I will have to update this review in a month.		Overall I would say that I have moderate acne, with cystic acne flare ups. many small bumps under the skin that don't become full fledged white heads, uneven skin texture and color, but not much scarring. I started the program with three nodules that have seemed to calm down quite a bit. What I have noticed is the discoloration from past acne flareups seems to be fading which I am very happy about.		I have not had any sensitivities to the product. I like the combination of calming, natural ingredients in the composition of each product. I had tried Pro active in the past and it did not work for me, but I think I needed something a little stronger. I am hoping that this combination will work better for me.		Good price, and I like that it's available at the store...Though I had to go to three stores to find it! Guess it must work well if it's getting sold out. May be easier to order on line in the future, but I wanted to try it right away to see if it worked."
B000KK53L6,2007,0,5.0,57,77,282,"Worked BETTER than Proactiv!!","First off I want to explain that I have had terrible acne off and on (mostly on though) for the past 8 years.  I had to be put on Accutane my sophmore year for 6 months in high school and then again my freshman year of college for another 3 months. I have been struggling ever since then and needed an alternative to dermatoligist bills and prescriptions for acne treatment.		I was having extremely painful and frequent breakouts in the later half of last year and in early November I happened to stumble upon this product.  I had my doubts because I had already given Proactiv a couple of tries in the past.		The first week of using the 4 products in the package my face became EXTREMELY dry! At first I was worried because it would always be a little red and irritated for the first hour or two after going through the routine.  However, within 4 days ALL of my blemishes (big and small) had cleared up! Within a couple of weeks my skin even became smoother, softer, and more even-toned.  Trust me, if you have problem skin and want to try something new, this product is definitely worth a shot!		Also, I love that you can buy this in pretty much any Walgreens and Walmart so it's very convenient...no waiting for it to be delivered.  I purhased mine at Walmart for $20-something in November 2006 and still have more than half remaining of each product in the pack.		Thank you University Medical for making an affordable product that actually works! Best of luck to all of you who are struggling with acne...and don't mark this one off your list!"
B000KK53L6,2009,11,5.0,28,37,468,Amazing!,"Let me start this out by stating that I am in my 30's and have tried every acne product known to man for about 15 years. I have seen a dermatologist, resorted to birth control and used everything from neutrogena to murad, as well as proactiv. None of these worked for me, and most actually made my skin worse.		When you're in your 30's and are STILL dealing with acne, you start to wish for wrinkles, because who has wrinkles and acne, right?!?! I was starting to think I would be one of the few dealing with both, and that was a pretty depressing prospect.		I usually check out reviews on everything before I buy it, but when I saw this product at target, and saw that it was marketed specifically for severe acne, I bought it without knowing a thing about it (sidenote: this product was 21.99 there).		I know it sounds crazy, but I saw a difference in my skin the next day, after only applying it before I went to bed. Prior to purchasing this, I had just had a terrible experience with Burts Bees acne products, which had made my skin red, even more oily, and had produced terrible pre-pubescent breakouts along both sides of my chin. After one application of acne free, the redness was reduced significantly, and some of my more painfull bumps had gone down in size...which is huge.		I was ecstatic, but had experienced these results with other topical treatments, only to be let down a week or so later, when my skin would eventually return to its angry self. So I waited two weeks before sharing my review.		It is now three weeks after starting application, and my skin has honestly never been so clear. I still have a few bumps, but compared to what I was dealing with before, I'll take them. Because this is a benzoyl peroxide based product, after a few weeks my skin became really tight, and that led to a few minor bumps. I started using an oil free, fragrance free moisturizer (olay regenerist), and that cleared everything up.		My husband has remarked on how much brighter my skin looks, and I am over the moon. I have even gone to the grocery store without makeup (and not wanted to die of humiliation). If you have skin like mine, you know what a huge, amazing thing this is.		Prior to using acne free, I had small bumps, whiteheads, and periodic cystic bumps that were super painful. It may not have looked severe to other people, but it felt pretty darn severe to me after dealing with it for so long. I would absolutely, whole heartedly reccomend this product to anyone dealing with acne. Just invest in some great moisturizer if you have sensitive skin."
B000KK53L6,2011,1,5.0,20,26,1113,"Worst skin to best skin in less than 5 weeks!","I'll start with a little background about me.  I have had acne issues since I turned 16.  I only really had it on my face but I got a lot of it and they never really seemed to go away.  My breakouts would mostly be on my cheeks, chin, forehead and around the edges of my nose.  I took many trips to the dermatologist's office with him promising me one day where I'd have clear skin like the Photoshopped models that were hanging all over his wall.		My family knew too many people that were on Accutane that had issues with it so I never got to try that remedy.  My immune system is horrible and that's half of what my problem was (or so I think).  My immune system got bad throughout my life from having too many antibiotics.  It got to the point where the antibiotics were also killing my good bacteria so common colds would even take me 1 month or more to get rid of.		I did, however, try multiple solutions in high school to fix my acne-related issues.  I tried pills, topical creams, lotions, special face wash, mud masks (I'm a guy so this was awkward), even my girlfriend's concealer to try to cover up the issue.  I was determined to get rid of it but nothing was working.  I figured my only true way out was to grow out of it or get some kind of laser skin treatment.		I'm very tall at 6'8"" and I have very large pores.  My skin is very oily and where some guys have a 5 'o clock shadow I have a 5 'o clock glaze.  When I finally got the ability to start growing facial hair it was helpful in covering up some key areas of my face.  After college, my skin seemed to start improving.  Maybe I was in the sun more, maybe my diet improved, maybe I was just finally growing out of acne.  It was never great or gone but it seemed to at least finally be manageable.		Fast-forward to 2 months ago.  I'm 29 and living the healthiest life I've had in as long as I can remember.  I'm finally eating 3 meals a day (compared to 1), eating less junk food, drinking less pop (soda) and yet somehow I got hit by the worst breakout of my life.  At one point in the midst of this breakout I counted 35 separate zits or red spots on my face.  Some started as white heads, some were just red bumps, some just red marks but the key point was that none of them were going away.  I'd pop the white heads and within 2 days they would be full-size again and now spreading like an infection across my face.		Hiding it was not a possibility anymore.  There was no makeup or magic solution to fix this problem.  I had no idea and still have no idea what the root of the problem was...I just needed to find a way to get rid of it.  I got a face wash/lotion combination called Rapid Clear from Neutrogena that was supposed to help bad breakouts like this one.  I went through that tube of face wash faster than I ever had before in my life (washing my face 3 times a day) and using the lotion when specified.		After one month of using this special combination I barely noticed any kind of difference.  What else could I try?  I happened to be at Wal-Greens one day about 5 weeks ago and saw the AcneFree Severe to Clear System and bought it for $30 after reading some quick reviews.  I know what you're thinking...after all this it's time to finally get to the review!		A lot of people mentioned how quick they noticed a difference and for me it was the same way.  I was completely blown away.  After just 2 days I already began to notice that the overall redness was diminishing and I did not seem to be getting any new red spots on my face.  Now it was time to see if the system could clear up the monstrosity that my face became.  I followed the directions and used it exactly as prescribed for 3+ weeks.  My skin is very oily, as mentioned earlier, but apparently not very sensitive.  I never had any issues with my skin feeling like it was burning, nothing ever felt like it was on fire (no matter how close I got to my eyes) and my skin did not dry out anymore than usual.  We have hard water at my house so my skin is always dry when I get out of the shower.		I love how this system has 4 separate parts that you can use whenever you want.  Granted, you'll definitely run out of the face wash a lot sooner than everything else but by that point you should be able to just use a regular face wash again.  So how good was it?		-- After 2 days, I noticed redness going away.	-- After 1 week, I noticed swelling dying down.	-- After 2 weeks, I noticed entire sections of my face starting to heal.	-- After 3 weeks, I noticed my skin feeling the softest and smoothest it's been since before hitting puberty.	-- After 5 weeks and current time, I notice that I'm no longer needing facial hair to cover anything up on my face.  This is by far the best my skin has ever looked in my adult life.  For the first time ever that I can remember, I can walk out of my house with confidence in how my skin looks.  A ""breakout"" for me now means one whitehead that goes away in 2 days.  I wish I could show pictures of what my skin looked like before and what it looks like now.		Words truly can't explain how satisfied I am about this product.  It's the only thing that actually worked and it seems to have even ""cured"" whatever skin infection I've been dealing with since I was 16.  You can buy this system in some places for $20 and for the price of an average dinner, drink, & dessert at a decent restaurant you can get the best looking skin in your life!		I only write reviews for products that I either COMPLETELY LOVE or COMPLETELY HATE.  This is one of those things that I wish I could give 6 stars out of 5.  I feel bad for the people that did not get the same results but I can definitely attest to the fact that it DOES work for some people.  Absolutely incredible!"
B000KK53L6,2012,6,5.0,1,1,260,"perfect combo/ systic acne","For all those ppl out there with systic acne this is a God sent. I had breakouts in my t zone constantly. Along with my lower neck plus those horrible bulbs of deep acne thay would leav my face with giant bruises and purple knots. After using this for three Weeks the results where amazing but still not what I wanted. I still had breakouts and I was determined to have perfect skin. So I began mixing this product with others. (yes I know your not supposed to) but I did find the perfect combonation for my skin and hopefully someone elses as well. First step is to throw away step 1 (the facial cleanser) and replace it with morning burst detoxifying facial wash. Use everything else as directed and add terminator 10 (an acne cream distributed by acne free). I used this combo for about four Weeks mind you my skin did get really dry the third week. To curb that I bought some cheap non oil bassed lotion from target and cacked on my face at night before I went to bed. witch cleared it right up. I have know been using acne free for four months and like the name I am acne free and know I only use the terminator 10 to keep my acne under control only using the full regimen once a week and my skin is covergirl commercial flawless. I will forever use this product! And on a side not the L'oreal youth code dark spot corrector works incredible well with acne free."
B000KK53L6,2012,3,2.0,1,1,60,"Worked at first","I bought this for my sister because nothing else has worked for her. This started to work and her acne was clearing up but then it just stopped working and all of her acne came back. YES, She was still using it the same. Don't know what the issue was, however I'm upset I lost money over another failing product."
B000KK53L6,2012,3,4.0,1,1,156,"Works to clear even the most stubborn cystic acne!","I've been suffering from acne since puberty but the condition worsened to become cystic close to a year ago. I've tried everything from dermatologists to every OTC medication and topical on the marke with varying degrees of success. Nothing worked better than this. I woke up to 10-15 active cysts and whiteheads and used this product in desperation.  Within 4 days I noticed a huge difference in the condition of my skin. Within 1 week my face was approximately 95% clear of acne.		I still have the dark spots which take forever to clear, which is typical for African -Americans. I do warn people to find an excellent non-comedogenic moisturizer and commitment to drinking tons of water prior to starting use of this product. I have extremely oily skin and still suffered through painfully dry skin through the first week of use.  Whatever you do, do NOT use this product within an inch of your eyes."
B000KK53L6,2012,2,5.0,1,1,115,"It works!","I had severe acne since I was 10 years old. It's been over a decade and my skin keeps having break-out. It never stopped and I was hopeless. I have tried many products, including Proactiv and the regular AcneFree for the last decade. However, nothing really worked, until I found it. Why did I not find it earlier?! Why did I wait this long to see it after my skin has been damaged by acne scars. All the acne is gone, I mean, seriously my skin is completely clean! Guys, just try it once, just once and see how it will change your confidence and smile. Make sure you use the Toner and the Moisturizer!"
B000KK53L6,2012,2,5.0,1,1,31,"This one really works!","Bought this for my nephew, he tried everything over the counter.This one really worked for him-and it was the only one. In 3 days his face was clean. He loves it!"
B000KK53L6,2012,2,5.0,1,1,95,"Better than anything else!","I LOVE this product. I'm 21 and I have a moderate amount of acne. I tried this product first (other than different types of soaps and cleaners) and it worked VERY well. I was thrilled with it. After a while i found some proactiv on a major sale so I figured I'd try it out. I don't think it worked nearly as well as this product. plus this one smells better. you also get more with this product than proactiv. Hands down, i'd buy this over proactiv and I'd suggest it to friends and family."
B000KK53L6,2012,0,5.0,1,1,194,"The only OTC product that really works for my 17 year old son!","The only OTC product that really works for my 17 year old son!  He plays football and after hours in a dirty, sweaty helmet, his chin and forehead would be awful, just covered in pimples.  We had tried so many other  products, including ProActive, and this system is the best. We have been using AcneFree Severe for over a year now and it really works. He did have a little burning and drying at first, but only for the first few days. It is like night and day. I can tell when he slacks off and doesn't do all 4 steps, because he will start breaking out.  But once he starts using the this product as directed, all 4 steps, twice a day, his skin clears up. His skin looks really great and his confidence has grown. If you have sensitive skin, I would try the regular version or the sensitive skin version of AcneFree.  I was purchasing this at our local WalMart $22, but I am going to start using the subscribe and save option to get it for $18.97 and ship it to him when he goes off to college next year."
B000KK53L6,2012,0,5.0,1,1,95,"Works great","This works great, I've seen results after the first use.  It's 1000x better than proactive or anything else I've used.  But I got really sick and stopped using it for a few days (unrelated to this), and during that time the results stayed that way.		Also, you CANNOT use this product if you are 13 weeks or less pregnant because of what's in the product.  It will harm the babys muscle growth.  I found this out when my sister took the kit to the doctors to see if she would be able to use this."
B000KK53L6,2011,9,5.0,1,1,354,"Worked when all the prescription stuff failed","This stuff is a lifesaver, hands down. I am 33 and have moderate adult acne. For the past three years I have been seeing a dermatologist and have been on Epiduo, Retin-A, Tarzorac, oral antibiotics, you name it. I have also tried ProActive and Skin ID. I was afraid my only resort would be to go back on Accutane. Accutane treated my acne as kid, and I was acne-free for years, but they say that people often have to do a second round of treatment 10 - 15 years later. Well, that's me. The problem is that the side effects can be horrible, it has been linked to Chrohn's disease and you have to wait a long time after treatment before you can try to have kids. With my wedding less than a year away, I was desperate.		I decided to try this product, and WOW! It took about two and a half weeks or so before I really noticed a huge difference. Now I am practically acne-free! This stuff is drying, so I often use a non-comedogenic moisturizer after the toner step to help offset the drying. Now that I am pretty much clear, I only use the products every couple days, using milder alternatives in between.		My acne is not the kind that causes massive scars, but rather is just the small persistent bumpy kind. I tried the severe acne formula first because nothing else seemed to be working on the persistent buggers and I wanted a strong first attack. Now I may switch to the milder formula for maintenance.		I strongly suggest anyone who is desperate for acne relief to try this product. I also bought the AcneFree Therapeutic Sulfur Mask and use it once or twice a week. I can feel a difference after using it and I do believe it helped in healing my acne substantially.		I cannot tell you how relieved I am that I have a chance of walking down the aisle acne-free. I was so upset with how my skin looked before this product, and now my confidence is back up and I am excited again!"

This is probably the most effective thing I've tried yet. Sometimes I have to use a lotion, to counteract the drying out of skin, but it still seems to be doing something. It seems to last a fair amount of time, maybe 2 months for one person, for the cost of it. You will also need cottonballs to apply one of the tubes that comes in it."

B000KK53L6,2012,11,5.0,0,0,483,"Wonderful product!","I am 21 years old and have struggled with acne most of my life. I had my acne under control with Benzamycin, a product prescribed by my dermatologist when I was 13. However, it began getting worse over the past year, and spiraled out of control when I stopped using Benzamycin and tried to fill in with OTC products. Unfortunately, when I went back on the Benzamycin it no longer worked to clear up the acne.		This product has done WONDERS for my face. In several weeks the product cleared up the cystic acne I had all over my chin and lightened the scars from old spots at the same time. Not only does it lighten old scars, but it seems to reduce the amount of scarring of ""new"" acne. New is in quotations because, while I do still have acne coming in, I believe that most of the pimples that are showing up on my face are from cysts that were under the skin for a long time and beginning to surface. I do use this product in combination with another retinol product, Atralin, which is prescribed by my dermatologist.		I would like to emphasize that this has made a difference in my cystic acne. I was diagnosed with PCOS this year, and am fairly certain that the acne I struggle with is a result of hormonal imbalances. While this may not work for everyone's hormonal acne, I think it is worth a shot if you are struggling with moderate cystic acne.	The only downside to this product is it does cause your face to dry out, and you will need a good moisturizer. My face feels a lot better, but sometimes I look in the mirror and I have dried skin all over my chin! Its a little embarrassing, but I'd rather have that then struggle with acne everyday. It seems to be a harsh product, but if you can stand the burning over the first few uses and are willing to accept drier skin, try this product!!!		I purchased this product after reading the reviews as a last resort, and I do not regret it! I only hope that it continues to work and my body doesn't build up a tolerance to it. AcneFree Severe may not be or everyone, but it has certainly worked for me. It has not completely cleared my face, but made a significant difference in a few weeks, and continues to make a difference after approximately 7-8 weeks. I liked it so much that I felt like I had to go out of my way to write a review - a first for me!		Just a side note - I bought this at a local Meijer for $24.99. The companies selling on Amazon seem to have higher prices for this item, so you may be able to find a better value at your local supermarket."

I have tried various products, and none have worked for me.  I bought this product and have used it for about 18 hours and my face is really much more clear.  I had painful nodules on my face and they are practically gone.  The swelling is gone and less painful.  I have used this product 3 times and It works just as it says. Results seen by next day.

None of this happened to me, i guess only if you have an allergic reaction or really sensitive skin. I started to see results in a couple days and i like the fact that it did not make my skin dry. Better than proactiv because you wont keep getting billed every month, you can order it when you need. The price is also reasonable and worthy."

So I decided to just use the soap on my T-zone for a while, and I got used to it- now i can use it on my whole face, but I only use it on my T-zone bc that's only where I have acne problems. Anyways, this product actually works.  I give it 5 stars because it cleared up my face, something I've been longing for for over 3 years.  I am so happy."

I am one of those people that gets those mounds on their face.  I don't get just a little pimple, they are almost like boils.  They're marble size, red, irritated.  And I can't stop touching them, which makes them worse.  I've done Clinique's 3 step system, neutrogena, clearasil, noxema, and the original Acne free.  At first my skin gets clear, and tighter, not as oily.  But after a month or so, it's back to bad skin. Just not as bad.  This stuff I've been using for about 2 months and I love it.  My skin is clear, it's not as oily, I actually have people tell me how good my skin looks!  I haven't heard that since I was a teenager (I'm 30 now).  At first this stuff was kinda strong and irritated my skin.  I just use the soap at night and noxema in the morning.  I do the toner in the am and pm, with the lotion.  Can't say enough good about this stuff."
B000KK53L6,2008,6,1.0,3,5,173,"DISGUSTING. AWFUL.","I stumbled upon AcneFree Severe because Clean n' Clear Advantage was out of stock (which, by the way, worked to a point then became completely ineffective). I wanted to give my skin a break from ProActiv, which I have been using for about 7 years and was working, but I think my skin started to become immune to it. I figured that if it worked, I would just make the switch, especially since it was only $20 and some change. WELL... so much for that!!! After 3 days, I had to stop using it because 1) the smell was HORRIBLE, 2) it made my skin feel like sandpaper, and 3) the lotion was soo thick, heavy, and gritty and left a white residue on my dark complexion. I would NOT recommend this product, especially if you plan to wear some sort of concealer or make-up; the lotion does NOT leave your skin smooth. Also, make sure your skin condition is indeed severe; that may be why it didn't work so well for me."
B000KK53L6,2008,3,1.0,3,5,118,"Not the same as Proactiv","For the first two weeks of diligent use, my acne became worse. However, I continued using it because what a lot of acne medications do first is bring all impurities to the surface as part of ridding your acne. My skin did improve, but by the time the bottles were nearly empty and six weeks had gone by, my skin was exactly the same as when I started the system. This product didn't do anything for me except waste my time. Right now, I am trying Proactiv, and just by comparing both system's ingredients I have a feeling that their ""Better than  Proactiv"" statement is false. I will write my review for Proactiv within the next few weeks."

I researched many products and decided to give this a try....so far I am very satisfied! I tried Salycic Acid in Clearskin, Clearisil, and Oxy and they all failed. So I was convinced my next step would be benzyol peroxide. Within after the first day my red blemishes stopped hurtin and began to dimish Quickly! It's been exactly 7 days and I do not have a new pimple at all. My oily skin slowly but surely has decreased a little.	NOTE: I do follow the instructions exactly as given and use no other product on my face except for eye makeup		I still have huge visible pores and will focus on minimizing them later . However my acne is under control and hope it stays that way. Thanks to AcneFree!		I do not give the product a full 5 stars only because it does not do everything I want. However it does do what it advertises which is clearing the skin of acne."
B000KK53L6,2011,8,5.0,0,0,543,"Best acne product out there!!","I suffered from moderate to severe acne for YEARS. I tried every product on the market - Clean & Clear, Proactiv, Neutrogena, Murad and even insanely over-priced Dermalogica. I had mainly white heads, with a few cystic bumbs. I also had DOZENS of tiny bumps on my forehead. I tried steaming my face a lot, applying clay masques, different vitamins, drinking apple cider vinegar (yuck!), and watching what I ate. No matter what I did, there was no change in the appearance of my skin.		I then discovered this kit. I used it morning and night...simple enough. At first it didn't seem to be working, all it did was dry out my skin a lot. However, after about 2 weeks of religiously using this product, my skin was clearing up...FAST. My acne scars were fading and the amount of acne I had diminished by half by the 3rd week. It is so simple to use, as well.		--Step One: Antibacterial Cleansing Wash		The texture of this is very creamy with tiny microbeads in it. It is a good exfoliant for everyday use, but I would recommend to also exfoliate with something more abrasive, once a week. No unpleasant scent, whatsoever.		You can feel your pores opening up in the shower as you rub this into your skin. After just using the face wash alone, your skin will feel 10 times cleaner! I love this stuff.		--Step Two: Corrective Toner		After getting out of the shower, with my face freshly washed with Step One, I apply the toner with a cotton pad. It gets absorbed into the skin VERY quickly, so you don't have to wait around for it to dry. It is very cooling and refreshing.		--Step Three: Maximum Strength Repair Lotion		This stuff works GREAT, but I do think there are some cons about it.	The texture is nice when going on- creamy and cool. However, it leaves a thin layer behind. It is not visibly noticeable, but if you apply makeup soon after...your makeup will not go on smoothly. So, I would recommend waiting at least a half hour before applying makeup.		I also use this lotion as a spot treatment. Before I go to bed, I cover any zit I have with it and let it sit overnight. The size and redness of the pimple is greatly reduced the next morning.		Step Four: Retinol Corrector		I'll be honest, I am not a huge fan of this step. Step Three is supposed to be used in the morning after Step Two, while Step Four is supposed to be used at night after Step Two. However, I usually use Step Three morning and night and only use the Retinol Corrector if my skin is feeling a little tight and dry.		This lotion is not oily whatsoever and really does a great job at fixing the moisture balance without causing a breakout like most face lotions I have used.		I have now been using this kit for about 6 months now and my acne scars are nearly completely gone and I rarely have a breakout. When I do, it is usually around the time of my period or if I am extremely stessed. Other than that, this product maintains my clear skin perfectly!"

The facial wash didn't seem to clean my face, and it wouldn't remove any makeup that I had on. Honestly, none of the products seemed to work (and in fact made my acne worse) and I ended up getting a Neutrogena face wash/mask that cleared up my skin in a few days."

B000MANVXG,2008,0,5.0,55,60,511,"exceeded my expectations","I am one that values the opinions of others and like most read reviews on an item prior to buying it. I was planning on buying an item 3 if not 4 times more $ than this item because it had better reviews and is a brand I am familiar with. I have better skin thanks to a recent Zeno purchase however you still have to wash your face several times a day. My old regime was using a puff buff and a cleanser that I felt was best suited for my skin. If it is a facial cleanser chances are it is in my toilette closet. When I bought this I thought this item would be my back up item. However, it has proven to do A LOT more than I thought. I have heard complaints about it not vibrating and that you have to do so. Or that a washcloth is better. After using it for several weeks here is my review. First of all let's face it, if you are left handed it is easy to clean the left side of your face and vice versa. I don't know about you but when washing my face and usually taking makeup off I leave the water running to rinse my buff puff. If it is a washcloth you not only get stains on it but it is all over your face and you waste more cleanser with a washcloth. I used the pads that came with the device and wetted them as instructed. It lathered up really well and I did not keep the water running. I felt it cleaned not only my face better but I was able to get my neck and side of my neck which breakout frequently as well. The best thing about this device is it is NOT just capable of using the pads intended for it. I am not a huge Dove fan and although it cleans well sometimes I need something stronger. I have stuck a buff puff on the device and then put on a heavier cleanser and it works great! I also have stuck face pads for a well know company that is more abrasive and also the Ponds facial clothes. They ALL stick to this device and I find myself cleaning my face a lot longer and cleaning it better. What I love the most is during the winter my hands get really chapped and blistered. Or even in the summer if you have a cut on your hand this device is a dream. No more running your hands under the water and applying it directly to the harsh chemicals and rinsing. The device is my fingers and it has truly helped my hands and skin since it touch my face, not my bare hands. I love this product and am glad I gave it a try and knowing it is so diverse I could not be happier. I think for the price you get what you paid for and a whole lot more! It is definitely worth it!"
B000MANVXG,2008,1,5.0,22,22,56,AWESOME,"It's WONDERFUL!  I have sensative, combination, flaky skin that is difficult to clean.  I had a stroke which hasn't helped my skin due to lack of circulation.  I also have difficulty using both hands to wash my face.  This is AWESOME!  My skin feels smooth and clean, which I haven't been able to achieve with masks."
B000MANVXG,2010,4,5.0,9,9,70,"BEST Facial Cleansing machine EVER!","After using this product you may never want to use wash cloths again. The SkinVitalizer gives just enough agitation to provide a GENTLE yet deep cleansing. It is a MUST HAVE addition to your daily beauty regiment. Since this item is no longer available... you may want to research sellers on AMAZON, EBAY, etc. for refill pillows before purchasing and stock up!. I purchased a second machine as a spare."
B000MANVXG,2009,4,3.0,8,8,90,"Does What it Says","I use this thing every day and it definitely makes my skin feel smoother and cleaner. It's gentle, but yet still removes all the dead stuff, especially when used often.		It's waterproof so I just leave it in the shower, and the face pads are usually good for 2 uses instead of just one.		The only thing I would name as a con is that it doesn't hold the pad as firm anymore because the little adhesive stuff (like velcro) is getting full of little pieces of the face pads."
B000MANVXG,2009,7,5.0,5,5,293,"An essential part of my beauty routine.","I recently reviewed a ""healthy skin"" drink called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021AF9GC"">Glowelle Powder Pomegranate Lychee 30 Day Powder Stick Pack, 30-Count Box</a>. I gave it a pretty good review, because I liked it, but noted it's very expensive.		Dove SkinVitalizer is a much more economical way to improve your skin. It doesn't have vitamins and the attendant benefits of that, but I've often marveled at how soft my skin always feels and how there's a noticeable glow afterward no matter if I use the more exfoliating side or not. I've been using this product since autumn of last year and it is part of my regular routine.		It's perhaps anecdotal to mention that within a week of first using the product I was buying cigarettes for a family member and got carded, which isn't bad at 40. I jokingly said to my husband that I found my new fave product, but it turned out to be true.		I think the pads are intended for one use, but there's enough cleanser that it could easily stretch to two face washings.		Of course, before  using it you want to mention it to anyone in hearing distance of the bathroom, because it makes this loud buzzing noise that, without telling them, you could only hope they would attribute to an electric toothbrush. ::grin::		To tell you how much I love this product, I often buy out the shelf of replacement pillows and hoard them in fear the product will be discontinued. I never want to be without this product and while the benefits are strictly external, I truly feel Dove is good for my skin, and that the SkinVitalizer gives that little extra bit of exfoliation and massage to make this a terrific part of a beauty  regimen."
B000MANVXG,2008,2,4.0,5,5,89,"Like Nutritioniste just cheaper","Check the weekend sales papers for coupons. I found a $ 3.50 Dove coupon, which lowered the price to $ 7.35 including taxes at Walmart. It is almost the same as the Nutritionist version, which costs a whopping	$ 30+. Mine even came with 12 pillows as opposed to the standard six.	It definitely smoothes rough skin, but don't press it too firmly onto your face. If you combine it with the generic brand facial cleaners you can really save suprising amounts of money for literally the same results."
B000MANVXG,2010,1,1.0,12,15,52,Useless.,"The cotton pad gets caught on the face.  I am a man, and I cannot use this on the area of my face where whiskers grow...no matter how clean-shaven.  It is impossible to exfoliate with cotton pillows.  Besides, all the device did was vibrate, which does nothing for exfoliation.  It should spin."
B000MANVXG,2010,8,5.0,4,4,79,"Love it BUT","I have been using the pillows for several years and love them.  Suddenly couldn't get them in the store so was very excited that I could get them on line.  Saw this product and ordered right away - really love it, but now I am finding it more difficult to find the pillows AND increasingly more expensive.  I could not find this product on the Dove web site which leads me to believe it will be completely discontinued soon."

It is much more convenient to use the cleansing pads by hand rather than with the skinvitalizer. I am really not sure what they purpose they think they are serving with this product.

B000MANVXG,2011,9,4.0,0,0,90,"For The Price? Great","Great for the price but I did have some problems. The pads provided, if they got too wet, would move around as I used them on my face. It is very easy to wet them too much and you end up with a lathery extravaganza. I can't say if it's better than just using a towel but it does make washing my face more 'fun'.		But those are small problems. It works as advertised. No one can buy this and feel ripped off. There is something very pleasant about that!"

It was easy to use but imediately found it producded way too much suds.  I had read the warning about avoiding the eyes and tried too, but the massager threw the soap too close to the eyes and I learned very quickly the warning is mild compared to the sting and pain the soap causes.  I have never had anything burn my eye like this soap.  My husband flushed my eye with no less than a gallon of saline water before the sting even began to  subside.

B000MANVXG,2009,5,5.0,1,1,95,"inexpensive skin improver","I see an improvement every time I use it. The little wand is not very expensive and I used mine for a year before I decided to replace it. I do this treatment on my face and exposed skin like arms. One side of the pad is exfoliating and then I turn it over for the moisturizer. Sometimes when my feet are very dry I use it on my feet! It feels very nice, wakes up the skin with mild massage and moisturizes. I do it for a few minutes before turning on the shower."
B000MANVXG,2007,11,4.0,1,1,36,"Good Cleansor","I like this wand. It works pretty well with the pillows you buy separately. I use it in the shower. After dropping it many times, it seems to be indestructible. Afterwards, my skin feels really clean."

For its performance price of 10 bux(walmart) seems  bit high too.		you can give it a try-	1. but don't expect too much.	2.You can do same thing with regular scrub... I am not sure if skin vibration will put some effects in long run. so far I don't see any.Plus I find they scrubbing pad a little bit harder too that I am not comfortable in using them everyday,"
B000MANVXG,2013,1,4.0,0,0,34,"Works well but you have to buy refills","I would recommend this product BUT you go through the soap-filled scrubbers quickly. They're really only good once so you're talking about a new pack a week. Leaves skin very clean and soft though"

I thought by it being a ""massager,"" that it would actually affect the way it cleans, as in helping to exfoliate my skin. But all it does is vibrate. There is ABSOLUTELY no need for that.  It has no affect on the cleansing ability."
B000MANVXG,2007,10,2.0,5,6,89,"Not that great","I essentially love all Dove products, but I was very surprised that I didn't care for this.  My biggest problem is the way the thing vibrates while holding it (I know that sounds odd since it's supposed to do that).  I just feel it vibrates excessively and it ends up tickling my hands and my face -- I even feel the vibration in my jaw as I'm scrubbing my face and it bugs me enough that I can't use it anymore.  So, instead I just don't turn it on."

Fell in love with it AND the various types of cleansing pillows available for different skincare needs. The massaging vibrations and cleansing treatments were relaxing and made my skin feel and look better. THEN the refill pillows started disappearing and now the entire line is discontinued :( When the cleansing pillows are available they're comparatively expensive, honestly NOT WORTH THE ADDED EXPENSE.		I like the device for helping me to focus on problem areas, making it easier to have better skincare and even some pampering. I've taken to using cotton rounds, cosmetic pads with my own cleansers and lotions as the different pillows for exfoliating, brightening, and mature skin vanished. When fibers clog the velcro, let it get totally dry then use tape to capture the fibers like old-school lint trapping :)		The one for my son's back-ne is used with acne cleansing pads like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7PJAC"">Oxy Maximum Daily Cleansing Pads, 90 pads (Pack of 3)</a> I'm sure the extra attention and the vibrations get the medicine deeper to the source of the problem which has cleared existing acne AND prevented more."

I was having acne issues along with chapped cheeks and dry itchy skin from the harsh winter winds at my high-altitude (endlessly winter seeming) college.  I started using this as a mini-peel 2 days a week leaving only until it starts to tingle only slightly.  Lathering on tons of moisturizer afterwards is the most rewarding part, your face feels incredibly baby-soft and smooth! I won't ever probably leave on long at all but I definitely notice the effects.  The first time I looked in the mirror after a treatment I was literally shocked because my pores were so smooth they were practically invisible! Not to mention my acne has cleared up entirely and my complexion is again glowing (think - post salty sunny beach trip shower:)	Not only will I be purchasing this, I'll probably experiment with their other varieties of peels.		&#60;To make application easier, try using a foundation brush to apply the gel, and rinse from brush immediately after application.&#62;"
B000PLUZL8,2012,10,5.0,1,1,328,"Great Product","This product is great. I am a 34 year old hispanic woman with a tn or mediterranean complexion. I never experienced acne until I turned 30 years old and when it came, it really came. I suffer from cystic acne that is terribly painful but not disfiguring, thank God. It has only left dark spots all over my face. Recently, some of the cysts, if left alone, would kind of dry out but leave hard bumps underneath. And other would not dry out no matter what. I had tried everything, saw about 10 different dermatologists but since it isn't disfiguring they would just stick to topical medicines.		I tried this as a way to even out my tone, but right before I received the product I got an episode of cysts.		I tried the salycilic acid on the forehead, where I didn't have a breakout. I followed the instructions but only left it for one minute. I didn't want to burn my skin. It tingled but didn't burn. It did not frost it just felt tighter, and my pores looked remarkably small and smooth. I was going to wait one week but then, all these pimples starting coming to the surface, and cysts too! I went back to the review and people said it was normal. I decided to wait.		Then, on my chin I had a bad breakout and the sulfur drying cream was drying my skin but not the cyst. So, in desperation I dabbed some of the salycilin acid and left it for 40 seconds. It felt like it burned, it forsted and the next day it was completely dry and scabbed. It didn't leave a hard bump. I must add that the process of scabbing was a lot faster than it would have been normally.		I am also using vitamin E oil and tea tree oil. I can't say if it will continue to work for me, but it did work this one time."
B000PLUZL8,2012,9,4.0,1,1,446,Gentle,"I have just begun using this product.  The product arrived promptly and as described.  I was concerned that it would be harsh and potentially burn my skin...was delightfully surprised that it is very gentle and my skin tolerates it easily.  I think that for me BHA is superior to AHA for my skin-type and I am using this to held reduce blackheads.  I have realistic expectations and hope for a little more glow in my skin and slightly cleaner looking/easier to clean pores.  Will update in a few weeks.	--	Update:  I am planning to do a TCA peel in a couple of months and I am priming my skin with Retin-A and Salicylic Acid peels.  Just started up the Retin-A again this week, so my skin is a bit sensitive.  Last night I decided to skip the Retin-A and do a Salicylic Acid peel again on my face, hands, arms, and chest :).  Well, I really felt the sting on my face this time!  I could only tolerate it for about thirty seconds with the fan on my face. With only 30 seconds, you cant expect much; my skin was a bit tight; when I woke up, it had a very even tone and looked lovely, which is a word I would rarely use to describe my skin :) To be safe, I am going to wait a week and then do another peel.  I will try to leave this one on longer (I will take Ibuprofin first to help the stinging) to help myself work up to the TCA, which is supposed to sting like a mother! :)  Really excited about the process.  The neck, chest, hands and arms didn't hurt a bit; left them on for the full eight min.  a little pink in the morning, but very even toned :)  could probably use a stronger % for those areas, but not too worried about it.		ADVICE FOR NEW PEELERS: If you are thinking that you might try a peel for the first time, I would like to encourage you to spend some time getting to understand how chemical peels work so you have an idea of what to expect.  Some of the reviews I see from freaked out people have a great deal to do with them not understanding how chemical peels work.  For me, the AHA 20% stings a tiny bit, the BHA (sal acid) MUCH more.  If you educate yourself first, you will feel so much better and not freak out if you frost, scab a bit or peel.  Its your face and it is really an emotional thing to go through, especially if you dont know what to expect."
B000PLUZL8,2012,8,2.0,1,1,248,"Be careful!","I had an 18% salicylic peel done by a professional.  The healing process was not bad at all. Some frosting during the peel and moderate dry skin with light brown patches for about 3-4 days after.  I got this product based on the rave reviews.  I figured I would try it out. I did 4 spot treatments on my face (2 on cheek, 2 on chin) just to see how I would react.  Thankfully, I did not coat my entire face.  I used a Q-Tip to apply.  I left it on for 2 minutes.  I had some frosting and moderate tingling, but not bad at all.  I washed it off with cold water and a little bit of baking soda to neutralize (I did not scrub with the baking soda). The patches were red and irritated.  Fine, ok, that means it worked.  To my dismay, I woke up in the morning with significant brown patches. The skin is very dry as expected, but the brown patches were much more noticeable than my professional peel.  Luckily I have some Obagi Hydroquinone cream!  I am applying that first, then Polysporin then Cetaphyl.  I just hope there is no permanent damage.  For all those acne sufferers, go get your peels done by a professional.  The gal I went to does the same peels to her face as the ones that she applies on her patients. Good luck and much caution recommended.  I will never use this product again.  Waste of money."
B000PLUZL8,2012,7,5.0,1,1,56,"It really works","I'm in my mid 30s and still break out.  After using the product for 2 weeks the break outs almost disappeared and my complexion has been so much more clearer.  The product is strong and stings my skin so I can't keep it on my skin for more than 5 minutes.  The Bottom line it works."
B000PLUZL8,2012,7,5.0,1,1,64,"Very satisfied","I bought this peel to improve the texture and tone of my skin. After three peels done weekly, I have seen remarkable improvements in the superficial scarring on my cheeks and a definite evening out of the pigmentation of my skin. My acne has almost completely disappeared as a result of these peels as well. I really wish I had tried salicylic acid sooner!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,3,5.0,3,3,389,"Wow! I'm in awe!","Not only did I receive this order SUPER quick, I was eager to use it because of ALL of the GREAT reviews AND I have been having flare ups on my forehead and chin for the last few months.		I am a 30 year old woman and of COURSE during my pre-mensa My skin gets oilier, but I am SICK of breaking out.  I've used 2 courses of accutane and I STILL get breakouts!? wtf!? It's RARE for me to get cystic acne but I do get MANY little clogged pores of both blackheads and whiteheads.  Although they are small, they are STILL noticeable. They also leave me with tiny brown scars!		I tried this product the first time and left it on for one minute.  I didn't feel much stinging EXCEPT where the creases are in my nose (beware for that area) -- washed it off after one minute and the next day my skin seemed a little better.  I decided I would try it AGAIN the VERY next day -- yes against the product directions, because I just didn't feel as if the one minute was thorough enough.  This time I left it on for about 4-5 minutes.  It began to sting and I had to wash it off because on my cheeks I just couldn't take anymore.  It stung for about 1 minute after I rinsed it.  I used Trader Joe's coconut oil on spots that felt and looked dry after.		The VERY next morning, my skin was NOTICEABLY better! Even my girlfriend said ""your skin is looking really clear, what have you been doing?""		There are still a COUPLE of tiny black heads on my forehead but they have decreased drastically, the skin on my cheeks looks a LOT smoother, its pretty fantastic.		I will use it again in a few days to see if it clears up the remaining blackheads on my forehead.  I feel hopeful and happy because this product works!		I've tried EVERYTHING too, and I was about to pay a lot of $$ to get a professional facial or see a dermatologist for some kind of help.		I say TRY this product at $20 a pop -- it's not a huge loss if it doesn't give you the results you seek.		So far I am MORE than happy with the outcome."
B000PLUZL8,2012,2,4.0,3,3,208,"I think it's working...","I've been using this product for 2 weeks now, and I definitely notice improvement in my skin. My skin is not breaking out terribly (there are still pimples, but there are less), the texture is smoother, and the large pores on my nose have shrunken!!  The first time I used this product, it did sting! However, I followed the directions and left it on for exactly 60 seconds.  FOLLOW DIRECTIONS WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT... If you leave it on for more than 60 seconds or you don't fully wash off the peel, your face will become red and irritated.  I suggest testing on a small patch of your skin prior to testing your entire face.  On the second and third peels, I left it on for 60 seconds longer.  Work your way into this product, as it is very powerful.		PROS:	-Works well	-Powerful	-Pretty bottle :P		CONS:	-Does not come with a fan brush	-Can irritate skin if directions aren't followed	-Dangerous.  DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT NEAR YOUR EYES.		OVERALL,	Yes, this product is absolutely worth the $$.  I would suggest anyone suffering from acne to at least try it, but do so with caution (i.e: avoid eyes, avoid leaving it on for longer than directed)."
B000PLUZL8,2012,1,5.0,3,3,454,"It works!","I have many crater scars from 11+ years of acne. I've tried many products on the market for scar removal but always end up with disappointment. I read some really good reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. I figured, it's $16, why not?! And my boyfriend has bad break outs occassionally so I figured if it doesn't work on me, he can try it out and see if it works for him.		I have to say, it REALLY does hurt/ burn the first time. I have a high tolerance for pain but when I did this the first time, it definitely bothered me a lot. I was jumping around in the bathroom, fanning my face with my hands... just wanted to get it over with! It felt like it's itching and tingling and burning. It was not a good feeling. But I feel like if it's hurting so badly, it's gotta be doing something good to the skin and it's gotta be working! From past experience, when I have a growing pimple, and if the product I applied burns, the pimple usually disappears the next day...		For first time users, I'd recommend rinsing with a shower head in cold water. It's very hard to rinse it off over the sink. Rinsing with a shower head is quicker, as well as calming down your skin faster so the burning sensation will go away faster too. It's almost like a rinse off + light facial massage!		After a couple uses, I find my skin more firm and vibrant. The scars are visibly lighter and slowly fading away. My boyfriend has severe adult acne break outs and he loves this product too. It does wonders in clearing away break outs. But it does take time.		So overall, I think this is money well spent. $16 is a worth try. You do have to prepare yourself for some pain... but you know what they say, ""beauty is pain!""		UPDATE (3/26/12): I'm still using this twice a week. It does wonders as a spot treatment. My boyfriend's very imflamed pimples die down after the very next day of usage. My crater scars are much better and my skintone is brightened and air brushed. The overall pigmentation is just amazing. I received many compliments for my skin and I barely need any foundation coverage at all. And after a few usages, the ""discomfort"" of the peel doesn't really bother me anymore. It's actually quite bearable! A lot of people recommended a neutralizer to use after the peel, but I think, start off with the peel and see how your skin reacts to it first. We never bought the neutralizer and it works fine without it."
B000PLUZL8,2012,0,5.0,3,3,351,"My skin is feeling better than ever.","I have been suffering from acne since 8th grade, and am now about to graduate high school and made my New Year's Resolution to get rid of my acne for college. I know it's something I really can't control, but I had a 50$ gift card to Amazon and was determined to find SOMETHING to help. I've tried everything. Epiduo, Murad, Proactive, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Clearisil, EVERYTHING. My acne has stressed me out more than school work, and I would always try to cover it up with foundation. I wash my face every day and nothing would get rid of or lessen my acne. I have horrible scars because I'm OCD with picking my white heads (even though I know it's bad) and just red sores all over my face.	I've been using this product for 17 days now, and my am I surprised. The first week, the redness in my face went down and my bumps lessened. Then the second week, my acne was way worse. Mostly due to my period and the fact that the salicylic acid brings out pimples to get rid of them. But now that I'm in week 3, I definitely notice a difference in my skin. My face is smoother, my scaring is DEFINITELY smaller, and most of my acne is going away. I still have a few bumps here and there, but I haven't had any new break outs in a couple of days. I got some Ph Prep and cleanser with this and use it before and after I use the product. I also apply some organic lotion stuff to help with dryness. I usually leave it on for a couple of minutes with minimum burn because my skin is pretty used to the acid from years of applying things with it. I do the treatment twice a week at night, and it's been good so far.	I'm going to continue using this product for the recommended 6 weeks and see what happens then :)	I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has acne, acne scars, and redness and wants results!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,0,3.0,3,3,208,"Salicylic Acid and Cold Sores","This product was not a good choice for me. Let me start by saying that I get an occasional cold sore. I have the medicine, Valtrex, which keeps these at bay. Anyway, I have a light brown, age spot on the side of my face that is about an inch by a half an inch. I bought the Salicylic Acid and read the directions, which state that people who use this product and have the cold sore virus, might get cold sores. I used the Salicylic Acid on the spot on my face and within minutes felt a cold sore coming on. I popped a Valtrex and continued to use Valtrex for the next two weeks while I used the Salicylic Acid. The spot faded slightly, but at the end of these two weeks, the inside of my mouth had a rash, and when I stopped the Valtrex, I felt another cold sore coming on. To me, this wasn't worth the possibility of cold sores, so I stopped using the product.		I wasn't sure how to rate this product. I didn't have any huge fading of my brown spot in the first two weeks, but I might have had more luck if I had kept using the product."
B000PLUZL8,2011,10,4.0,3,3,169,"So far so good","I've done three peels so far and am happy with the results. It definitely burns when you put it on, so I've only been able to tolerate it for about 4 minutes. It has shrunk my existing acne dramatically each time I've used it. The next day I wake up and it's almost all gone. I've also noticed that my skin is much less oily and my pores much smaller. I notice that I peel two days later - which is annoying, but what gets the results. I just make sure I use a heavier moisturizer on that day and night, and I exfoliate with a facial sponge and that takes care of it quickly. I am also using Clinique's acne solution system and started both around the same time, so it may be the combination of the two that's producing the results. But either way, I'm very happy with how well my skin is looking these days. Can't wait to see the results of another month of use."
B000PLUZL8,2011,5,5.0,3,3,172,"Has helped my breakouts","I have used this for about a month now and my breakouts have definitely decreased.  They are not completely gone yet and I'm not sure if they will but my skin is dramatically better than before.  I started with a lactic acid peel and that alone did not do much.  I went to skin laboratories website and saw that this helps with the other peels so for the past two weeks, I do a combo.  This peel first then lactic afterwards, once a week.  Then I just use this peel two more times during the week.  Now I am peeling like I have a sunburn and I am black.  The skin underneath is beautiful and soft. A few things to note:  Go to skin laboratories website for better information than what is given with the package.  Moisturize... a lot (it will help with the skin peeling)!  Last but not least, DO NOT PICK at your skin!  It is very sensitive and will scab.  Loving the result and hope it just gets better."
B000PLUZL8,2011,5,5.0,3,3,283,"It Works!","I have tried everything under the sun from prescription to over the counter and nothing has worked on my acne. I started using this as a last resort to try and combat my acne and acne scars. I have never used a peel before so I didn't really know what yo expect but I gave it a try and I haven't looked back. When you first put it on you will feel an intense itching and/or burning. You may experience white spots on your skin after you wash it off but it is temporary and will vanish after you moisturize. I started seeing results after two weeks and my acne scars are finally starting to disappear. I am biracial and the scars take on a dark brown to red appearance. I am only on level one, but if I am seeing this kind of results I can't wait to work my way up.		I do have one piece of advice. The directions say to use a brush or cotton ball but that technique didn't work for me. I went and got a medicine dropper and use it to put the solution in the palm of my hands then I spread it with my fingers. I am able to apply the solution faster and spread it more evenly. This method also makes you use less solution so you will have more than the 15 applications that are in each bottle. Just make sure that you wash your hands with soap and water after the solution has been applied to your face. Read all the instructions, and most importantly listen to your face. If it is peeling or irritated allow more days in between uses."
B000PLUZL8,2011,5,5.0,3,3,134,"This product rocks!!!!","I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who has suffered from acne for about 4 years now. We had tried prescriptions like Retin-A, Tazorac, etc... I have bought her proactive and many over the counter products that just didn't work. The second week of using this her skin was clearing up very well. This is the 4th week and her skin is almost acne free. I have recommended this product to everyone I know that suffers from acne. Its very strong so you may want to start out only using once a week and then gradually work your way to 2 to 3 times a week. I due recommend using a good moisturizer after. Now I'm gonna try the glyclorid peel to see if that will help with the scars that's left."
B000PLUZL8,2011,4,5.0,3,3,52,"Does What It Says","Great Product. Will clear up your skin like it states. Make sure to use moisturizer because it will leave your skin feeling dry and flaky for about a week. Keep the product on for as long as you can up to the 8 minutes recommend max for prime results. Will purchase again!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,2,5.0,2,2,178,"I will purchase as long as they sell this!","I wish I could give this more stars! I love this product.		I have tried absolutely every skin product known to man (I am in my 30s and have had problem skin since I was in the 4th grade). It is not necessarily a miracle cure, but a HUGE help in fighting the good fight. It has helped with clogged pores, fading scars, etc. It also seems to speed up getting rid of any acne type cysts.		I did NOT see results the first time I used this though. The results got better and better as I used it. Now, you can practically see blackheads begin to melt after I use it. Two things helped me improve my results:		  1. exfoliating regularly	  2. using a toner with alcohol before the peel		This seemed to help the peel penetrate deeper. This is only my experience and I know products don't always work for everyone. Silly me purchased another peel form this company and it was like dabbing water on my face. This is definitely the right fit for me."
B000PLUZL8,2012,1,5.0,2,2,308,"spot treatment, very strong","One of the reviewers said that it would be used best as a spot treatment and I totally agree.  20% is really strong.  I recommend making a baking soda/water solution before you apply the peel.  It Can burn, as in leave white patches that peel like mad for days.  It will also make your face blotchy and uneven, if you do too long too quickly.		Some skin on my face could take it, the area around my mouth could not.  The 3rd or 4th time I have done this peel(not regularly), After 4 minutes I RAN to the sink and as I passed a mirror I was horrified to see a bright red ""goatee,' after a total face application.  I rinsed and rinsed, and put baking soda on it, repeatedly for about 10 minutes, then rinsed again and slathered my face with Olay Definity Night Cream. (I don't know why, but I swear this stuff HEALS my acne marks if I pick or they are bright, takes half the time to heal up- nice of Olay to discontinue the line.)  After a couple hours I put on Eucerin redness relief night cream, which is also a miracle worker if you have redness in certain areas of your face.  I do not have rosacea, but I do have a lot of redness around my nose and chin.		As for what the peel does for the acne, sore bumps under my skin that will begin to raise in a couple days totally disappear, ones that are closer to ""zit"" have the process speeded up and they reach zit that day, gone the following day, and just a little red the 3rd day.  After 4 days whatever issues you had are pretty much gone.  With diligent moisturizing (and NO PICKING), you will not have any visible sloughing.  Enjoy your clear skin!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,0,5.0,2,2,975,"Eczema and Acne Solution in a bottle","Like my title says, I suffer from both eczema and acne. I've had eczema my entire life, but I didn't develop acne until last year. It hit me REALLY hard, and it was hard for me to fight back. Most treatments helped the acne, but made my eczema worse. And if I used a product for eczema, it would clog up my face and make the acne worse. Proactiv was the best treatment I used, but for a college student, it was expensive to keep up with. I had stopped using anything on my face for such a long time, and it has left dark spots on my cheeks, rough patches on my chin, and pimples on my forehead and along my hairline.		After seeing such good reviews for this product, I gave it a try today. All I have to say is that I'm impressed. There's no visible change in my skin, but it feels so much more soft and clean than with any other product I've ever used. Like the pamphlet said, my skin did feel a bit dry after using, but the dry sensation went away on its own without needing a second product. I think a previous reviewer mentioned being Tyra Banks' complexion--which is the same skin tone as I am, so I did see some redness on my cheeks, but I'm 90% sure it was because of the wash cloth I used (it was a bit rough, but I didn't have any other clean ones).		While using the product, my skin did burn and itch while it was on. It was very hard to not scratch it off. so, anyone who reads this: PLEASE do not hesitate to wash it off. I could only keep mine on for about 3 minutes. You may do permanent damage to your skin if you don't wash it off when your body clearly knows that it's time. The itching/burning wasn't as intense as I may make it seem. Its more like the itching you get in your feet while you're driving, and you just can't reach down to itch it (I HATE that feeling...).		Another thing I will mention is that you may want to speak with your dermatologist before using the product if you don't know how your skin will react to it. I went to see my doctor about two weeks ago for a routine check-up before buying this. It's always better to be safe than sorry!		Overall, even though it's my first day on this product, I'm very happy with it. My skin feels so much healthier, which is a blessing for someone who has lived her entire life with multiple skin problems. I will try to continue to update with my progress.		P.S. You may want to go out and buy a light lotion/moisturizer to go with this skin peel. Not only for your face, but for your hands as well. I accidentally got some on my fingers, and my hand dried up like a sponge in the desert.		------------------------------------------------------------------	Day 1:	Used the peel twice for no more than five minutes--once in the morning and once at night after my shower. The reported ""burning and tingling"" was minimal and no visible changes in my skin were seen. Skin felt cleaner and the rough patch on my chin had improved.		Day 2:	The ""rough patch"" on my chin has nearly disappeared with three light treatments since day 1. The burning sensation while using the peel was more intense than from the day before, so only used it once and will most likely skip a treatment for day 3 and just use my normal moisturizer. Pimples along my hairline and on my forehead haven't changed. The dark spots on my cheeks have lightened slightly. Pores don't seem to have changed much.		Day 3:	Skipped the treatment for the day.		Day 4:	Skin has started peeling! The peeling that's most noticeable is on my cheeks. The acne on both cheeks has improved greatly, however, my forehead hasn't changed. It might have to do with my period starting soon, since my acne breaks out during that time of the month anyways. The rough patch on my chin has no visible change as well. I did another treatment right before bed to help with the peeling, and used a regular cream moisturizer afterwards.		Completed Week 1/Into week 2:	Its been over a week and I'm a couple of days in to week 2 (I've lost track...). So far, so good; my ultra-sensitive skin has taken well to treatments. I've noticed a pattern, though it may differ from person to person. I don't use the peel everyday. I use it (for example) once on Monday. By Wednesday, my skin will begin to peel. I'll use the treatment and then I'll be fine. Then Friday, it starts all over again. My face has really started to clear up. I was very worried because eczema has made it hard to put any product on my skin. Most make up, perfumes, and lotions break my skin out into a rash. The pimples on my forehead haven't completely gone away yet, but they're getting better slowly over time. The pimples on my cheek are 90% gone. There's a few remaining on my right cheek, but they're hardly visible. My chin hasn't had a pimple in days, but the skin is still a bit rough to the touch, but just by looking at it, you can't tell that anything's wrong with it. It could just be dry and I need a better facial moisturizer. My hairline has improved dramatically. I used to have pimples all along my brow, but now its like nothing was ever there. I'm going to start looking for a better moisturizer to use that might help push the treatments along. Otherwise, its still an amazing product!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,11,4.0,2,2,326,"Good for first-time peel users","I just used this peel (10 minutes) ago. I followed the instructions but left it on for almost 3 minutes instead of the recommended 1 (for initial contact). There was very little burning/sensitivity, perhaps because I have thicker skin and used to other products.		I'm in my 30s and get more acne now than I did as a teenager.	Oral contraceptive pills worked for me but I do not want to take them anymore for possible negative side effects.		I will probably increase the time to the full 8 minutes and frequency as others have to see faster results.	I kind of wish I started with a stronger concentration as funds are limited but I think this will be a good start.		**UPDATE**: January 1, 2012 (Happy New Year)		I used this product on a Monday (3 min.), Wednesday (7.5 min.), and Friday (7.75 min.).	Today is Sunday and I am peeling much more but it's a peeling the way I used to peel when I first started using Retin-A.	So, yeah, the dark spots left from pimples are lightening and I am definitely shedding old skin.	I just bought a stronger concentration from Skin Obsession because I would like more intense results. I was @ a doctor's office where an employee had tried one of their peels. I am not sure what combo/concentration she had but she had dark skin patches on her cheeks. She explained how she has been peeling. It looked like a severe sunburn, I guess (never really experienced a sunburn that bad), but it looked like the peel was pretty intense and there were ""more"" layers of skin being sloughed off.	That is what I am looking for.	With this product, for me, I just get ""light"" peeling. So, if that's what you want which I think anyone who does not have too much ""skin"" issues might, this is the perfect product. Maybe I'm just impatient, he he. Hope this helps."

However, I've notice that as long as I get regular facials with someone who is Good with extractions and follow up with a light peel, my skin clears up. But Today, not many of us can afford peels at $85-$150 a pop!!!		I am so Glad/Happy I found this product online. I am so naive and had NO Idea I can buy these peels online without a license, especially at these price (duh). Now I feel like I got rip off all these years by paying a professional to do something as simple as a Light Peel.  It is important to know how your skin will react to a peel!!! I've many over the past few years, so I know! For someone who has Never had one, I would highly recomend going to a professional to see what % they'd use on you and then you'll have a better idea on which one to order and what to expect.  I am 40 years old, I guess it is fair to say I have ""thicker"" skin and takes 20% peel with out any problems. This does NOT mean every 40 year old Skin will have the same reaction! Some people have ""thiner"" skin layers and 20% may be too strong, especially if this is your First. Everyone is different!		Now that I've tried 20%, I will move up to 35% maybe I'll even go up to 50%. The 20% helped me with the black heads: they fell right off! Love it! This one is good for every 10-15 days treatment but b/c of my age, I'll need something stronger for the fine lines on my forehead. Warning to you virgins: THIS WILL STING/BURN AT FIRST! HAVE A FAN CLOSE BY AND WATCH YOUR SKIN TO BE SURE IS NOT ACTUALLY BURNING. SERIOUSLY, I'D NOT DARE TO DO THIS IF I DIDN'T HAVE DONE SO MANY OF THEM OVER THE YEARS, DONE BY PROFESSIONAL. GOOD LUCK!!!!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,11,5.0,2,2,108,"This gel peel is key to eliminating acne.","I could ramble on and on about this product but I'll just keep it short, it works amazing if used correctly.  First, don't use it more than every 4 days or so depending on your skin.  I used it a couple days between, and I literally burned my skin.  This stuff is strong and is not to be taken lightly.  If you follow the directions you should see a significant improvement in your skin within a month.  The changes will be noticable everytime you use it though.  I suggest using this only at night (your skin will be a little red afterwards) and use a good moisturizer afterwards."
B000PLUZL8,2011,10,5.0,2,2,154,"great do-it yourself peel","a friend recommended this for me. I have acne scars and though I know they're not going to go away, I just want something I can do at home to slough off the top layer of the skin. This works great. At first I didn't even notice much peeling, but I realized that it was because I wasn't putting very much on. I used q-tips and with a small tip not very much was getting on my skin. So while it felt hot while it was on, it didn't result in any peeling. Then weeks later I used a cotton ball and that did the trick. I kept it on for a little over 3 minutes and it was hot, very hot. My skin peeled a lot 2 days later. The peeling lasted for days afterwards, but I like the result. The little white heads are gone and pores look smaller. I recommend this."

I tried everything: Proactive, Epiduo, and even antibiotics that my dermatologist recommended. Then I decided to see what was the best reviewed acne treatment on Amazon. I was not disappointed! This peel is absolutely incredible. I've been acne free for months! You rub the gel on your face with a cotton ball and let it work its magic! The one drawback: it is an extremely intense pain. It feels like a burning acid is eating your face. The first several times I barely last a minute. However, the more you use the treatment, the less painful it gets. Beauty is pain!

It cleaned up a lot the acne on my face including the dark spots and the pimples. Although it takes time this product really worked and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to rid their face of acne or other irritations.

They were unfortunately too high. I've been using this product now for about a 2 weeks, almost everyday. The first few times I only left it on for maybe 2 minutes at a time. (Perhaps that is why I am not thrilled with my results thus far) The past two times I've left it on for 5 minutes. I took a before and after photo from when I first started to last night and I honestly see no difference. I MAY have some less acne, but I definitely do not see a huge difference. I was really just hoping this would help me with my past scarring and overall appearence of my face. I will continue to use it maybe...

B000PLUZL8,2012,0,3.0,0,1,359,"OK not the best not the worst","I bought this product with very high hopes. I have had acne scars for about 2 years and finally decided that I needed to do something about them. Considering this is the first time I have ever had an chemical peel on my face professional/unprofessional I decided to pick one of the lowest chemicals, being this 20% peel. I was definitely very scared when I first did the peel. I had everything I needed and followed all the directions. Washed my face with a mild cleanser (Cetaphil), dabbed my face with alcohol to remove excess oil, and then took vaseline and lined my mouth eyes, and near my nose to protect from potential chemical burns. I put the peel on with a cotton ball and it stung almost immediately. I managed to cover my entire face but only left it on for a minute and then quickly washed it off with lots of very cold water. I then put on an oil-free moisturizer with 35 SPF Neutrogena brand. My face was red but it completely stopped hurting. The next couple of days I patiently awaited results but saw none. So the first day I applied the peel was a Sunday. On Tuesday I decided to try it again. Following the same exact steps as my first application except I left the peel on for about 4 minutes. Once again it felt about the same. Days later no real results. I guess my pores have gotten smaller, skin softer, and it is a bit more ""glowy"" but alas my scars have not faded. I tried the peel one last time Friday for about the same results. I decided my skin needed a deeper, stronger peel. I am glad I tried the product though and know that my face can handle chemical peels. I think this is a good starter peel to really see where you are at regarding chemical peels and your skin. I have purchased the  TCA 15% peel so let's see what happens. It arrived in the mail and I have put it on. I will write results on that peel once I know them. Hope this helped!"

It works well to clear up acne breakouts for a few days, but it has not stopped the breakout cycle.  I have battled mild acne for years--the kind where no matter how well I wash my face and no matter what product I use, I still see a few small pimples every day, and there's the occasional larger breakout of 10-20 little pimples.  The results from this peel are not miraculous (maybe I could use something stronger?) but I have had no adverse effects such as peeling, redness, irritation, etc., and I can say my skin is a little better than it used to be on a daily basis, though it was never that bad to begin with.  For me, the best product to clear acne and soothe my skin is still Queen Helene's Mint Julep Mask: the next day after using that I always see all my pimples have shrunk and/or disappeared, and my skin is softer."

I've used this peel four times over the course of a month. All that's happened is that my nose has gotten flaky and i got two random dry patches on my cheeks.

I didn't lay out in the sun. Now, 6 or 7 weeks later, my skin has never been in such terrible condition.

This is a starter peel, meaning an idiot can apply it, your face won't burn off. I was terrified I'd have peeling, horrible burning, etc. But, it wasn't too bad. Slight burning after a few minutes. The price seems reasonable enough, too. I don't know if this is appropriate or not...But I use a fan brush to apply the peel, leave it on for ten minutes and wash it off with really cold water. Of course, before applying, you aren't supposed to use micro-dermabrasion products and you're supposed to have a very clean, dry face. I bought cellbone technology's Prep Toner to use before applying the peel.		It does dry my skin somewhat. But honestly, it's really easy to use. It will tighten your skin, no matter your age. It's helped with acne somewhat as well. I think in combination with good face products, anyone will probably see some good results. It freaked me out a little but because after one use, my face looked like a child's. I'll use it until it's gone, then I'll probably try the Glycolic or maybe a combo-peel once I feel confident enough to do so.		I don't know if this helps but I am 25 years old, very fair skin, also mild-moderate acne. Maybe it's the peels or maybe it's the investment in expensive (ish) face products, but I have seen marked improvement.		Oh, and don't pick at your skin after using this."

Here is my own direction: I place a few drops of gel into my palm. Then I massage it into my face and let it sit overnight when I sleep. It stings but it's tolerable and fanning it helps a little bit, too, but do not wash it off. The stinging sensation will die down after 30 minutes.		For 2-3 days afterwards, the skin begin to exfolidate and peel, revealing fresh pink skin underneath, just like the result of the $70 facial professional job.

I had such high hopes for this item, but unfortunately it has not worked for me. i used the peel exactly as directed and from the begining my skin has reacted horribly. I broke out worse than ever with deep painful acne. Reading all of the glowing reviews and the exhortations to stick it out, i continued to use the product once a week for eight weeks, hoping that the impurities in my skin were just working their way out and i would eventually stabalize. Not the case. The acne got worse and i developed dark scarring. Six weeks later, under the care of a dermatoligist specializing in people of color, my skin has mainly returned to the pre-peel state as far as the breakouts are concerned. The scarring, however, has not diminished and I don't know if it will. I used to not wear foundation, but now I feel i cannot leave the house without it. My skin tone is so uneven that I have become very self-concious.		PLEASE- if you have a darker skin tone, are prone to scarring or hyperpigmentation, consult a professional before putting this product on your skin.

B000PLUZL8,2011,4,5.0,21,23,450,"Robust Medication","I ordered this product after my last attempt of searching a solution for my persistent acne.  I've been suffering from acne since age 14 (I'm now 20).  I tried everything from Proactiv Solutions to every over-the-counter acne medication available on the market.		Warning:  This product is extremely strong and extremely concentrated and thus must be used with high caution.  Before you apply this product I will recommend testing it on a small section of the skin prior to use on face.  I will also recommend applying this product on to some kind of cotton pad to use as an applicator to facilitate the application process.		This product does just as it claims --  after an application it will cause your outermost layer of skin to fall apart.  You will notice the peeling within a few days or even hours.  I had never heard of chemical peels in my life but when I read the amazing reviews this product had on Amazon I decided I had nothing to lose.		It makes sense that the most potent way to make best use of a topical medication is to attack the skin in a way such as this (i.e. by shedding).  Proactiv and other topical medications are only programmed to be dissolved into the the epidermal tissue of the skin, so to me it makes more sense that by causing the outer skin layer to shed and be renovated, it will do a lot more (in terms of clearing skin and reducing pore size).  After all, even though we may not notice to a daily basis, new skin cells are consistently in rejuvenation and our skin cells are multiplying to replace old skin cells.  This happens although we might not see it.  Processes such as this one are common in nature.  For example, snakes shed their skin layer almost every season.  This product is only a catalyst and to an extent greatly accelerates this process.		This chemical which is extracted from a plant hormone does tend to dry out most skin types.  I will recommend some kind of moisturizer to alleviate the drying of the skin.  If you suffer from hyperpigmentation, the shedding of the skin will eventually even out the spots as new layers of skin are generated.		This product has been a panacea to the problem I never thought I could resolve.  All of my persistent acne has disappeared (completely!).  I suffer(ered) from hereditary acne and this has been the only product in the market I have found that's been as successful as it claims.  I feel that Professional Laboratories has done a splendid job by doing an exhaustive research and then presenting this product to the public for cosmetological use."
B000PLUZL8,2008,9,5.0,40,47,151,"Perfect for controlling acne","This peel is just perfect. It not only works on the scars but also helps control acne. I've used it for 4 weeks now (applying it once a week ), and haven't had a single new breakout. The peeling is subtle, but none of my blemishes are visible anymore.		Although the instructions say not to keep it on for more than 5-7 mins, I keep it on for 2 hours. I'm not saying everyone should do that. (I did try keeping it on for 10mins for the first time and nothing happened). Maybe it's because my skin is used to salicylic acid.		I have been using the Neutrogena 2% salicylic products for three years with no great results. And this peel worked wonders in a month. Needless to say, I've discontinued using them.		Also, the processing was pretty fast. Got it in four days flat.	All in all, a wonderful product."
B000PLUZL8,2009,5,4.0,127,157,540,"Definatly works!!","At first i was skeptical of this acid peel, but changed my mind soon after.	I took before photos to see the change the peel would have on my face, and its only been about 4 weeks, but i will take pics soon of the after results after 6 weeks.		Im 20, male, white, with slightly oily skin, and acne that sometimes turns horrible on me and makes cysts only on cheeks though. One cyst next to my eye and eyebrow left a bad scar.		This stuff does tingle a bit, but very bearable. Used first for 2 mins, and had no effect, upped it to 4, same result. Used the full 8 mins the next day, started to see improvements. I modified the instructions a bit because my skin is used to exfoliations by 10% benzoil peroxide which only made pimples smaller and face a bit dry.		I used every other day for the full 8 mins every time. But i suggest follow their instructions first before adjusting it. No down time here, and no redness like some people mentioned, and i dont apply moisturizer. The skin feels same before and after application, but results can been seen a few hours after the application as well as increased results over 24-48 hours. The company suggests using a moisturizer, so dont take my word for it that you may not need it, so start with that. I started first using this product with a moisturizer but i think it clogged my pores and cause mild acne.		The results i got were:	-Pores got smaller noticeably on the nose, but not as much on the cheeks.	-Face became much more smoother, the scars got blended in(not the major ones thought)	-Face is less oily after application as well as for the next 24 hours or so. No moisturizer was needed for me, as the amount of oil on my skin after use of the peel stayed at a perfect level.	-Face got lighter (can be seen in my pictures), and red spots from old acne lightened up slightly.	-Acne breakout decreased alot. I no longer get acne on my cheeks and forehead. My problem is the nose and chin, mainly the bottom portion of the nose.		Final Comment: I would recommend this product to first time chem peel users. My sister is trying it right now. My skin is not sensitive, so i will be looking for a stronger solution, maybe 30% salicylic, or 35% glycolic. May buy this (in the 100 mL bottle) after i get rid of my red spots to maintain an acne free face.		Ill keep you guys updated with what happens in the next 2 months or whatever because its only been 1 month, and full results may take much longer. btw, i still have half the bottle left after 1 month use.		Update (aug 16, 2009): I ran out of the stuff and have ordered another bottle, but i have not been getting acne after i stopped, so i think it played a huge role in it. Much less red spots compared to 3 months ago. Scars did not really change much. Skin also feels much more smooth without any pimples appearing all the time."
B000PLUZL8,2007,10,5.0,85,104,51,"Great for a light peel","Product works great, noticeable immediate improvement, though not drastic. I have been repeating it and have not had harsh results, just the expected peeling. I have large pores on my nose, chin and between eyebrows. After the peel I notice a change in pore depth and size. I am very impressed."
B000PLUZL8,2008,5,5.0,167,208,300,"Great Product on Ebony Skin","I started getting acne young, when i was about 10 and i didnt know how to look after my skin then. No cleansing, toning or even moisturizing because i thought that would give me more spots, what a fool i was.	The problem with black skin is that it hyperpigments easy and by the time i was 21 i couldnt bare to look at myself in the mirror, i had  so many acne scars i couldnt stand it. Dermatologists were no help, the pills and creams are useless if you dont have a good skin care regimen which is something the doctors dont usually tell you.	In 2001 called around and was told by everyone on Harley Street that dermabrasion and skin peels were not for black skin tones so i paid PS1800	for lazer treatment. It worked to some extent, the spots went and my skin looked clearer but if i had known about this product i wouldnt have bothered.	The truth is that these skin acids can and are used safely on ebony skin tones and have been for years. I am a caramel complexion (like Tyra Banks), my first peel ever was the Skin laboratoty 70% lactic acid peel and i experienced no problems at all, just be sure to follow the instructions. My second peel was the salicylic 20% peel by Skin Laboratory and my skin looks great. My skin is visibly clearer, lighter due to the fact that the hyperpigmentation is fading, i just look great and i'm so happy. And for the price, its a bargain compared to PS200 per month on microdermabrasion or PS1800+ for a course of lazer treatments. I would highly recommend both the product and the company. I honestly cant imagine my life without these peels now, i'm totally smitten."
B000PLUZL8,2012,0,5.0,16,17,453,"the search is over!","problem: extremely oily skin with huge pores and a bad case of rosacea.	i'd been searching for a product that would shrink my dime sized pores without aggravating the rosacea (like other products do). after a year of investigating i looked further into the salicylic acid peel and found that this is the best product to use for pores because it works from the inside out, not just the surface. mine are truly the largest pores i've ever seen so i was keen on trying it. i'd been using 2% OTC which helped reduce the redness from rosacea but it didn't really shrink my pores so i assumed the stronger formula would but i was concerned that the stronger formula may aggravate the rosacea until i discovered that salicylic acid is aspirin related and i know that aspirin has a calming effect on rosacea, so this nailed it for me.  i ordered it and began using it right away. i knew it was going to sting but nothing prepared me for the heat. it is intense. i left it on four minutes the first time before rinsing with cold water. something i noticed is that once i splash cold water on my face the heat intensifies for about a minute then stops all of a sudden. i'm up to eight minutes now and still, the heat intensifies when i begin rinsing. it's not an issue with me, just something i find peculiar.	i do my peel at night, starting with a clean face and i tone with alcohol soaked cotton ball to remove the extra oil from my skin. i use an artists brush to apply and once the peel is rinsed off i follow up with Oil of Olay 15 spf for sensitive skin.  the combination works well for me without breaking the bank.  i also apply the same Olay during the daytime.	well...... after years of looking for a miracle product my search is over. after a months use the tone of my complexion is around 95% improved, it's smooth with no redness, no itchiness and no dry scaly patches (from rosacea). normally if i went without foundation on my face people would comment on my sunburned, that's how bad it was. but now no one says anything and they don't even stare.  i still have a tiny bit of redness in my nose creases but i look for that to disappear too. as for the pores they are about 50% improved which is a miracle in my book and i think they will get even smaller with continued use. i will use this product, if needed, forever. i am 100% satisfied with this product. fyi, i also posted pics.... http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/A2NQF4KTRFWC0U"
B000PLUZL8,2011,7,5.0,16,17,453,"Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel is The REAL Answer to Great Looking Skin","I started having severe adult acne breakouts in 2004. Since that time, I have tried every conceivable product on the market. When the OTC products had no effect, I consulted a dermatologist. Talk about adding insult to injury, the treatment(s) I received through the dermatologist aggravated my situation even further. I felt like a walking nightmare. I became so self-conscious that I found every excuse not to leave the house unless absolutely necessary. I couldn't even make direct eye contact with anyone for fear that they were looking at my horribly broken out face caked with makeup and powder to hide the volcanous ruptures underneath. I know, I know, the makeup and powder was only clogging my pores further and exacerbating my situation. Denial is a horrible master.		When I saw the Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel on Amazon.com, I was reluctant at first. I had tried numerous products with certain percentages of salicylic acid in it, but I took note that this product was a GEL PEEL with 20% salicyclic acid. I was familiar with peels and how they were supposed to lift off severe acne scarring and associated discolorations in stages through a peeling process. I didn't know much more than that about the science of peeling, but 20% of salicyclic acid seemed more like a percentage a dermatologist would prescribe. I ordered this product on a wing and a prayer, and I have never been happier.		For anyone out there who is considering having a iron mask forged to hide their adult acne, DON'T!! Buy this product and use it as directed. DO NOT exceed the amount or timing-this is a chemical peel. You will do damage to yourself by thinking, ""If a little worked so well, a lot more will work even better."" WRONG. Be patient. I guarantee you the results will be evident almost immediately. As for any stinging or burning sensations, there was very, very little (almost negligible) that I experienced--and I had become used to some products causing me severe reactions with no improvement whatsoever.		Not only does this product rid you of your current acne situation, it will help recondition your skin to prevent further breakouts--it actually firms your skin as well! REMEMBER: Apply moisturizer after washing off this product, and you will look and feel great! If you're feeling hopeless, I implore you to give this product a try. Friends and family have not stopped complimenting me about my new, beautiful skin--they say not only do I look great but I look younger, too!! Makeup will become your friend again. You will turn heads again--but for the right reasons. Three great results for the price of one! BUY THIS PRODUCT AND START LIVING AGAIN!!!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,7,5.0,12,12,208,"Smaller Pores?! Yes, Please!","I've always heard that you can't shrink pore size... whoever made that statement has NOT tried this product! I'm in the last year of my twenties, and over the past year my skin has been at its worst-- acne, old acne scars, congestion, wrinkles, unevenness, and the worst of all... HUMONGOUS pores. I've tried so many things... facials, expensive cleaners and lotions, etc. I'm SO HAPPY that I finally discovered the magic of salicylic acid! I'm on my third week (using it 2 times a week), and OH MY GOODNESS, my skin looks awesome! Especially the pores! They're dramatically smaller, and I didn't think that was possible. My skin is so much more even and smooth, and the acne scars are beginning to fade. I even got carded ordering a drink for the first time in at least TWO YEARS, so obviously other people are noticing my new youthful looking skin. ;)		It does sting quite a bit, so be prepared! The first time I could only leave it on about a minute and a half, and now I'm about to five minutes. The peeling is barely noticeable, and my skin looks so vibrant and healthy after each peel. I'm so glad I finally found something that works!!"
B000PLUZL8,2009,11,5.0,12,12,139,"Another good review","I reviewed this back in the summer. Loved it then, love it now. I'm African American with a Medium to Dark Brown complexion. I've had cystic acne along my jaw line since having a baby (about four years). It does burn the first few times but you tolerate it more and more. It worked within 2-3 months. My patience has built up after using sooo many products and waiting for results. This is it. Within 3 months the scars had faded. The ""Cyscic"" acne was gone AND not coming back. I wanted to give face a break and just purchased the ""lactic"" peel. BIG MISTAKE! No real results from that in the last 2 months and it caused hyperpigmentation so its back to the Salicylic. If you really have an acne problem give this time be patient it works!"
B000PLUZL8,2008,3,4.0,6,6,238,"Works like it's supposed to","I bought this and the glycolic/lactic acid combo peel at the same time. The first time I used this, I could only keep it on maybe a minute as it was really uncomfortable, and I don't have particularly sensitive skin. But subsequent times I kept it on for long er with no problems. I would use this once a week, alternating with this and the gly/lac peel, for about 4 weeks, then the last 2 weeks of my first cycle I would put this one on first, leave it for a couple of minutes, then apply the gly/lac over the salicylic and leave on for another few minutes. I then stopped using for a few weeks, and went back to just using a clay mask once a week to give my skin a break. In that break time though, my skin has stayed clear, with very few blemishes, and the oiliness in my t-zone has been definitely reduced. I think it did help to make my pores appear smaller, if for no other reason that that less oil is being produced. I didn't notice much difference in fine lines, but I don't have many wrinkles anyway, and I don't think it penetrated enough to help reduce acne redness, but since I'm not breaking out anymore that will help overall reduce acne redness. Definitely recommend for problem skin as an alternative to pricy dermatologist's peels- it's the same thing!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,1,5.0,8,9,353,"Love it! Love it! Love it!","I had severe acne before I started using the Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel.  Before I used this product, I tried everything!  I had gone to many different dermatologists and have done everything from being on birth control, taking antibiotics (which killed all the ""good bacteria"" in my body and left me with severe yeast infections), and even having a laser peel on my face.  I even used Accutane twice, and still I was left with severe cystic acne.  I gave up on any kind of help from the medical professionals and started reading up on what alleviates acne.  My acne before was so bad that I was breaking out even along my jawline.  My acne was very persistent, I felt hopeless. I came across this gel peel and tried it out.  At first it peeled and flaked my skin.  The first application had a burning sensation on my face.  However, I stuck to using the product faithfully and what a difference!  My skin is so clear that I have gotten compliments from people at work. I have been using this product for almost a year.  I also use the other acid peels on this website.  The amount you get lasts a very long time.  My husband also uses the peel for his face and it has done an amazing job on his skin.  His skin looked rough before, but now it looks smooth.  I have found that I do not have to use the peel as often anymore, but I do still need to use it for maintaining my clear skin.  Another great thing about this product is that it evens out my skin tone.  I had brown blotches on my face after having the laser treatment and being put on birth control.  They have since faded into oblivion!  I can't say enough good things about this product.  One last thing I have to say is that this product is cheaper and more effective than the $500 laser treatment I paid for and all those doctor visits and useless prescriptions I paid for! It has been a real life saver for me!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,2,5.0,5,5,430,"Miracle Product","I am a 46 year old male who has had bad acne from my 20's until present. I tried all of the OTC products as well as several cycles of Accutane over the course of 26 years. A friend of mine at work who also had acne started clearing up a few months ago so I asked him what he had been doing. He told me of this product and his regiment (don't all acne sufferers have one)he suggested that I give it a try as there was nothing to lose other than some money. I started around 6 weeks ago and here is how it went:		1. week one: After the initial use, I started breaking out a little more with a lot of whiteheads and sensitive under the skin bumps. (this is the phase where it all starts to come out and basically is purging the skin)		2. Week two: Still breaking out but the skin is beginning to look tighter and more youthful with smaller pores. I was really starting to doubt the product but my friend told me to stick to it and I did.		3. Week three: Still breaking out but not as much with the pimples disappearing at a faster rate and smaller pores.		4. Week four: My skin looked and felt better than it had in years of doctors visits and medicines.		5. Week five: My skin has never looked better and the scars are beginning to fade		6. Week six: My skin looks great! I have never been happier with my skin than I am now this product is awesome.		I have read reviews of folks that it did not help and my heart goes out to them, I sincerely wish them luck in finding a solution. But if you do have this product give it at least 6 weeks before you decide that it does not work, after all you have had acne most of your life and 6 weeks is a blip on the radar. I would recommend the a Neutralizer skin pH balancer as it most definitely helps with calming the skin post peel.		My regiment now consists of Aveeno Active Naturals Ultra Calming Foaming Cleanser, along with Acnefree salicyclic foam that you leave on the face and Clean & Clear Persa-Gel 10 Acne Treatment.		I do the peel no more than once a week and as other reviews have stated do it on a few days/nights before, if you will be going out as it does make your skin a little sensitive. I hope my review is helpful."
B000PLUZL8,2011,5,4.0,5,5,122,"I just used this yesterday evening, and. . .","I am a black woman, with caramel skin tone--- and I do believe this will be part of my routine skin care regimine!!!		I noticed immediate improvement, though not drastic. I have large pores on on my cheeks--on either side of my nose and my forehead, small blackheads on my nose. I usually use Queen Helen mint julip facial to help with my ""enlarged pores"" and it seemed to be only an immediate fix-- a day later they looked like craters again.  However, after this peel I noticed a change in pore depth and size. I woke up thinking ""Oh my goodness are my pores huge again"" -- but today (2nd day after peel) they still are minimal!!!  I am very impressed."
B000PLUZL8,2011,3,4.0,5,5,318,"No joke","This stuff is not a joke.  But I like it.  I'm 39 & have been suffering w/adult acne for way too long and have tried so many products.  I believe my problem is probably internal but this peel helped clear me up some regardless.  The first time is recommended at only 1 minute & I thought that'd be no prob since I've put myself through such torture in the past to get clear skin.  OMG it was more than uncomfortable & I couldn't wait for a minute to be up.  I didn't see or feel any results right away but it did bring some yuckiness to the surface right away....a bump under my nose (ouch).  You shouldn't apply again in less than 5 days.  Three days after I saw results.  I was peeling around the edge of my nose & it was kind of gross & I was in public...in a restaurant (very classy!) & even worse!...I had no idea other than my nose felt weird & dry.  The second time I could stand it much easier.  It really depends on the cleanser you use prior to.  The first time, I used a gel (Neutrogen Grapefruit ""something"") that was very drying & the peel just aggravated that dryness.  The second time - I'm not gonna tell you I forgot it was on! - but it was much less uncomfy & I could leave it on longer.  The cleanser I used that time was a Cuticura bar soap (drugstore.com) & that's a lot less drying.  The third application was no problem.  This does dry up/heal stuff you may have messed with (like I do).  My ""polka dots"" are fading & I have hopes that this will take care of some minor sun damage as well.  This is not a miracle end-all be-all cure but I'm glad this stuff exists...I had kind of given up hope for any topical treatments!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,1,4.0,5,5,133,"Patience is a key thing to remember!","If I had rated this product two weeks ago, I would of given it a 1 star. This is because after applying this my skin broke out even more. However, I read some reviews and they stated that the reason it broke out was because it was bringing my future breakouts up top. So I didn't give up, I applied this peel twice a week for 3 min. This is my third week and right now all the breakouts are drying and clearing away.	It's true my skin starts to tingle when I apply the salicylic peel, but it's good because I know it's working. Overall I am impressed with this product because it helps clear my dead skin and regenerate new skin.	P.S: I am an asian, if that makes a difference."
B000PLUZL8,2010,6,5.0,5,5,256,"Great for Persistent Acne","My struggle with acne is much the same as everyone else's-persistent acne that refuses to quit despite medication and special washes and creams like Proactiv and skin i.d. (which by the way don't help much unless its very mild acne). I was skeptical to go so far as Accutane because I already have a history of depression without it being egged on by yet another medication. When I discovered this on Amazon and read the other reviews, I decided to give it a try since so many others seemed to have success with their serious acne and skin issues. I know they recommend the BHA as best for acne, but it seems to dry my skin out so badly my skin overproduces oil and makes it worse. This is the best balance for me, as well as the glycolic acid they make. On first use it can burn quite a bit, but after several uses you don't notice it so much. And as other people have said, you want to wash it off your face with the coldest water you can find! I am absolutely astonished that after so many years of battling and trying to hide my acne, it is gone for good, as well as all the scars and pock marks from picking and squeezing to get rid of blemishes anyway I could. If you have any doubts about buying any of the peels to help with your skin issues, squash them and don't look back! You'll love what you see in the mirror!"
B000PLUZL8,2009,9,4.0,5,5,275,"In less than a month's time, there is a noted difference in my skin.","I have been fighting blackheads ever since my teens. Even with washing my face twice a day, proper toning and moisturizing, they never seemed to disappear. Beyond the blackheads that plague my t-zone, my skin is in good shape.		I researched online for tricks to remove blackheads and was advised to try a salicylic acid mask on my problem areas to clean out the pores. The first time I used it, I followed the directions of keeping it on for only one minute (and building it a minute at a time each use) and I used it on my whole face. After rinsing with cold water and moisturizing my face well, my skin was ridiculously soft. The next day my skin looked glowing but there were still blackheads. As I used it every 3 days since then, the appearance of the blackheads on my t-zone has diminished. I know they are there because I analyze my skin too much but overall the quantity and size of them have been reduced. I have been using a pore minimizing toner with it as well to help tighten up my pores too.		I am really happy with the results but definitely test this product first to make sure it is safe for your skin and only use it on problem areas at the recommended every 3 days because I was using it over my entire face and noted some spots were getting dry. I figured leave good enough alone. Also it does tingle, a lot. At the point I was using it for 4 minutes, it got unbearable at the 3 minute mark but I sucked it up."
B000PLUZL8,2009,4,5.0,5,5,143,"I don't know why I didn't try this before","Normally I don't write reviews, but this product is totally worth it, first the shipping was super fast, I ordered it on April 29th  got it in the mail day before yesterday May 6th, really impressive because I'm in Toronto Canada.	I tried it last night in my face and my back, I have really bad acne scars , I have a hormonal problem and even thought my acne is gone the  scars were really bad.	It was amazing, it's just the first time and my face looks way better, I can't notice any changes in my back so far, but I'm hopping for it to clear too.		Anyway don't think it twice, I don't know why I didn't try this before, I was contemplating getting laser done, but this seams to be an easy fast and inexpensive way to solve my problem."
B000PLUZL8,2012,0,4.0,7,8,460,"It works, but not without some discomfort.","My husband bought me this stuff as I am 27 years old and I have been dealing with acne my entire life. I have tried EVERYTHING! No really, everything over the counter, and everything prescription short of accutane as I refuse to take that horrific drug. (that is a whole other topic)... regardless he purchased this for me in the hopes it would help. I have been using this for 4 weeks now and waited to post my review as I wanted to see if it would really work/help. Here are my recommendations and words of advice for you if you are thinking of purchasing this product:		1. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FULLY BEFORE APPLYING!		2. The directions say it may tingle slightly when applied... this is an understatement. It burns! To aid in this while the product is on your face fan your face with some paper or put your hair dryer on cool while the Peel is on your face. This will take the intensity of the burn down. (slowly increase the time you leave it on your face, don't leave it on the full 8 minutes the first time as you don't know how sensitive your skin will be to this stuff)		3. Rinse with cool water, not too cold, and NOT hot. Your face may be a bit red (like a sunburn) but it doesn't last long, I HIGHLY suggest doing this at night before bed.		4. Apply a REALLY GOOD lotion, don't skimp on cheap facial lotion here. I have and my face felt like sand paper, get some good thick face cream. This peel will suck everything out of your skin and you need to replace some of it.		Now this is where I don't so much like the product, I have been using it for 4 weeks and I have worked my way up to leaving it on for 4.5 minutes. My skin peels every week. My skin is sensitive and I look like a snake for the first 3-4 days after using the product. Even using good lotion I still peel like crazy. I know it is a skin ""peel"", but I can not wear make up however, my skin is  getting softer and smoother so hopefully in time I won't have to use it every week. (On the up side, if you had a HUGE pimple you needed to take care of stat you could dab this stuff on it as a spot treatment and seriously overnight it sucks it dry, a HUGE upside to this stuff. It KILLS active acne in its tracks)		My only two down falls with this product is the burn, and the peeling, you may not peel at all, but know that it may be a possibility."
B000PLUZL8,2011,9,5.0,1,1,138,"Fabulous for tough skin","This is my second order, and I find the gel works well to encourage peeling, and thus minimizes the appearance of blackheads. However, I also use rubbing alcohol before every application (which the instructions suggest and my doctor recommended). I can use the gel more than once weekly for more than 10 minutes each with no adverse results BUT I do this only after careful patch tests, starting with one minute on the inside of my elbow and working up, minute by minute, on my face. I do not use the product on my forehead or near my eyes. Those who complain that the gel is ineffective might consider applying it after a steam bath and the alcohol swabbing. One caveat: this product makes the skin extremely delicate and prone to tearing if you apply pressure with fingernails."
B000PLUZL8,2011,9,5.0,1,1,520,"It Works and I'm lovin It :)","I been using this product for a few weeks, now. Let me start by saying the first time I tried it, I didn't apply it ""right"" (LOL). I was scared that I was going to damage my face or something...since it is acid you're using. Anyway, the first time I applied it, I applied very little and barely rubbed my face with a cotton-pad, so honestly I didn't see much results in those few days. The only thing I experienced was a little bit of stingy...so after seeing my face didn't burn off or anything like that, I did it again the third day (applying 2.5 ml, and rubbing my face according to the directions with the cotton pad). The bad thing was my face was a little irritated (since I did it twice the same week)but that was it. By the fifth day, I saw positive results. So, for the NEGATIVE reviews that I read before trying it; maybe you didn't apply it the correct way to your face or read the directions thoroughly. Well anyway, I use this product once a week and my face does not get irritated (unlike the first week).		I am mixed with black, white, and Austrian, and I have oily skin.  I always had pimples since 8th grade, and it got worse after my first pregnancy. I tried every kind of cleanser you can name...Neutrogena, Biore, ProActive, spa treatments...spa treatments every month did me good BUT it is a bit pricey. After using the Salicylic Acid (20%) for 3 weeks now, it cleared my mild pimples off my forehead, and my huge pores had tightened up. Now that it is the third week, most of my huge pores that I got before has either shrunk, or disappeared. The first day I started this product, I had a very large pimple on my cheek...and by the second week, 'that pimple' shrunk, the third week (today) NOTHING is there (that pimple is GONE; not a scar, not a spot, no blemish, NOTHING). I also noticed other large pores shrinking into small pores, AND my small pores disappearing. My face is a lot smoother and glowing. If I could put pictures up from before and after, I would :)		The reason I give this product 5 stars is because it is the only product that gave me the best results within a week, AND I had/have no breakouts (what so ever) since I started using this product.  It will take time and patience for some of you who has the worse break-outs, or bad acne. However, depending on your skin type...either you will see immediate results or it may take a couple weeks or so to see ""The Happening.""  My advice to a beginner (like myself) is to FOLLOW the directions. The first day you try it for the first time, try focusing on that one pimple on your face (day-by-day for 5 days)...take a picture daily if you need too. That is how I was able to notice ""It Works!"" You will see the changes like I did and by the way, IM LOVIN IT!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,9,5.0,1,1,517,"Works great","If you plan on going to a spa or dermatology to spend hundreds of dollars for a peel, you are wasting your money. I purchase this 20% aha peel along with their 35% peel, shipping was fast, I got it 3 days after I place my order. If you have never done a peel at home, I highly recommend you start with the 20% and as your skin get use to it then move on to the higher concentration. Better to be safe than sorry. I've done chemical peels and VIPeel, I spent thousands of dollars, that went down the drain. One VIPeel treatment cost me $375 and that was on special, 6 weeks later I did another VIP treatment, I saw no improvement in my skin so I did not do the 3rd treatment as the dermatology recommended. I even spend hundreds on the products she sold me that did not work, but made me break out. With the chemical peel and VIPeel I was embarrassed to go out as my face would peel and it looked disgusting, people would stare at me. During the peel my face use to burn badly, hours after the peel my face was still be red. It took days for the peeling to stop. After all the dead skin fell off my face, I looked refreshing and the fine lines gone, however the brown spots from acne and sun were still there. Even if you have done a few peels please start at a low % aha peel.		I used the 20% peel for the 1st time on Friday night, after about 2 minutes my face started burning. I had set the timer for 4 minutes because I figured I've done a few professional peels which was much stronger than 20%, I could tolerate it, I was wrong... I managed to let it sit for 3 minutes, I couldn't bare the burning so I rinsed with cold water, then I used a neutralizer which stopped the burning immediately. I let that sit for 5 minutes then I rinsed with cold water, pat dry, then put on moisturizer. Immediately after putting on the peel I saw my pores shrink so that was the 1st sign of satisfaction with the peel. Saturday when I woke up my skin felt dry but tight. Sunday I had a little flakes, but after I wash and use a toner it wasn't noticeable. Today is Monday and my skin is peeling, it is somewhat similar to the peeling that I got from the peels at the spa except not as bad. I can't wait to see what the new skin looks like and I'm looking forward to the 2nd application which I will do Wednesday or Thursday night. After I'm done with the 20% aha, I'll be using the 35% aha. The instructions says to take a break for 1 month after using the 20% before using the 35%, that I'll be doing. I love this peel and the price is great. Not only will your skin looks great you'll be saving a lot of money."
B000PLUZL8,2011,9,5.0,1,1,144,"Seems to work","I've only been using this product for 2 days but on the first day I noticed results the morning after I had used it. My pores were smaller (not by a lot but still noticeable). When I applied the solution to my face I could literally see that it was drawing up the oil in my pores. Literally. I had the burning sensation that the majority of the users here also had but it wasn't that bad. My cheeks were a little pink after using it but it went away after 10 minutes. I've had acne since I was in grade school and this is the only product that I've tried that actually seemed like it really works. I'll report back in a few weeks to report my results but I have high hopes that my skin will be much smoother and more appealing."
B000PLUZL8,2011,6,5.0,1,1,160,"Good results thus far","I've been using this peel for a month now, with a total of 4 peels done on my face and back. I have acne and dark marks, olive complexion, and real oily skin especially in the summer months. It hasn't helped with the oily skin, but it has diminished the amount of acne, and reduce the pigment on my acne marks. I've used the glycolic peel of the same brand 3 years ago without any luck. This peel stings a lot when I apply it to my face, but not so much on my back. I have built 2 minutes tolerance for my face and that has helped to reduce my acne. I do use benzoyl peroxide and a prescription tretinoin for my acne and the combination of it all has helped keep my acne to about 1 eruption a week, where before I was getting one or two new pimple a day. I hope I continue to get results."
B000PLUZL8,2011,5,5.0,1,1,155,"Works better than I expected","I have heard a lot about this acid and decided it was time to try it for myself.  I can tell the difference, like some of the reviewers mentioned, it doesn't completely get rid of a scar (nothing does) but it did what it was supposed to, blend it in a a bit better. Newer scars seem to fade better than  older ones. I would buy this again. I didn't quite know what to expect when I bought this. After reading instructions I gave it a shot, it burns somewhat but no worse then putting a liquid bandaid on. After a few days or so I noticed the top layer of my skin was starting to peel. Week and a half of using it every other day and my skin has peeled twice and returned to normal.		Keeping scars out of the sun or at least protected from the sun is very important as well."
B000PLUZL8,2011,5,5.0,1,1,69,amazing!,"After three uses my skin looks so much younger. My once super deep, big blackheads are almost gone. This is a miracle worker. Definitely worth what you pay. It says to leave on for one to eight minutes, but i could only leave it on ten to fifteen seconds. Buy this and you wont regret it. But be careful to follow direct exactly, so you dont damage your skin."
B000PLUZL8,2011,5,4.0,1,1,84,"after affects isnt as pretty","I have done a couple of peels so far, but my only issue is the scarring that this stuff has done. My suggestion is if you use this product stay indoors for some days , because your face will not look pleasant at all. after two weeks or so your skin and acne does look much better. I guess you have to take the good with the bad here. you must treat your skin afterwards. overall , a decent product for acne prone skin,"
B000PLUZL8,2011,4,5.0,1,1,48,great,"Great product I have just used it once but can feel the difference my face feels smooth and less oily, I ordered the cellbone pH neutralizer along with it and they actually give a free 15ml sample of the glycolic 35% peel. The shipping was really fast too!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,1,5.0,1,1,72,"Great for Acne","I bought this gel peel for a family member with acne. It was easy to apply with a gauze pad and caused minimal discomfort for the 8 minutes it processed. The results were immediate. Dead skin was beginning to shed and excess sebum had been pulled to the surface to be rinsed away. There was some flaking for the next 48 hours. We are very happy with the results after 3 applications."
B000PLUZL8,2011,11,1.0,2,3,49,"Did not work.","This did not work for me.  I tried it exactly how instructions showed and even though it  made me break out more i stuck with it for months, in the end it just did not work.  I had tons of little pimples all over my face worse than before."
B000PLUZL8,2011,9,5.0,2,3,128,"Love It.","I never ever had acne as a teen. Then something happened at age 28 (adult acne) and the past 3 years have been horrible for the skin on my face. I have oily skin apparently and after just 1 application of this my skin dried out tremendously. The texture also appeared different right away, I will use this once a week for a month and I have a feeling I will see good results. Beware this peel does burn like fire. I am an experienced peeler and this one hurt from the second I put in on. I lasted 2 minutes in front of an open window with cold air blowing in. Start slow because this stuff is no joke. I did not actually 'peel' either.	Good Luck."
B000PLUZL8,2011,0,2.0,2,3,32,"Ive tried a lot of products","Ive tried a lot of products and this one didnt really work for me... I read other peoples reviews and was excited but didnt clear up much and I stop using it"
B000PLUZL8,2010,8,5.0,2,3,212,"Milder than expected.","I am 51 years old, with oily skin, moderate breakouts, mild acne scarring, forehead wrinkles, and slight jawline sagging. I have been using store-bought SA products for decades with no noticeable improvement. This product makes all the difference! It was much milder than I expected during and after application. First application, I had it on for 8 minutes with minimal to moderate stinging and redness. On the second application I had it on for 10 minutes with minimal stinging. I had no noticable peeling or redness afterward, and a slight improvement in the texture of my skin (smoother). I hope to see smoother, clearer skin after using this regularly over the next several weeks.		UPDATE: I am now 53 years old, and have been using this product as a weekly peel and daily spot treatment for about 2 years.  After using almost half the bottle, I diluted it with witch hazel and added a few drops of tea tree oil. It is an extremely effective spot treatment and weekly peel. It keeps my skin clear and smooth, and is mild enough to not need rinsing off. After 5 minutes of application, I just add my other skin-care products. A homemade anti-oxidant serum and oil-free moisturizer. I have happy, clear, refined skin, FINALLY!"
B000PLUZL8,2010,4,5.0,2,3,41,"Just what I was looking for!","I don't use this all over my face.  I did a couple times, I didn't like the result too much.  I dab a little bit from a Qtip right onto an emerging pimple and it disappears so fast. I love it."
B000PLUZL8,2010,0,3.0,2,3,133,"Really dried out my skin.","I have been using this peel for a few weeks now hoping for great results like I read in the reviews. I'm not sure why, but this peel REALLY dries out my skin - just on the bottom have (jaw, lower cheek). I have very oily skin, so this was unexpected. I followed the directions and left it on for less than a minute each time, but still ended up w/ several brown patches of very dry, scabby skin. Then two days later I start to peel severely and this lasts a few days. I'm sure it's a great product, I just haven't had good results. It did, however, reduce oil and blackheads. I'm going to try it in combination w/ the Lactic Acid 50% peel as recommended and see how that goes."
B000PLUZL8,2009,0,5.0,2,3,176,"Pretty Effective","Ok...never tried an at-home salicylic peel but this was pretty good. The directions said to use to before the acid peel (and Acid/Beta peel) but I wasn't sure about the pH or the sensitivity of my skin to this stuff.		Although--I plan to try a salicylic/glycolic peel back to back I feel as if I may have to use a weaker salicylic. My glycolic peel is strong (40-50%) and I'm scared that it may overwhelm my skin.		Anyway--I've never done a full-face salicylic peel.	I peel section of my face but I mainly use the salicylic for spot treatments once a week (i apply with a q-tip). You have to assess your own skin sensitivity to see what you can/can't handle but salicylic can be left on the skin as a spot treatment.	***Just don't try this with Lactic or Glycolic acid.***		But it works well. Thank God for peels. They're an excellent addition to my skincare regimen. It keeps my acne away. I have to buy more actually. I may try the 30% next time."
B000PLUZL8,2008,4,4.0,2,3,41,"I think it works","It works to shrink existing zits and I think it softens the scars as well.  I haven't used it long enough to know for sure.  But for the price, it's definitely worth the try.  Go easy on the first few applications."
B000PLUZL8,2013,1,2.0,0,0,46,Ouch,"I got this product thinking it would help with my adult acne. However, after months of using it, feeling the burn and never seeing any results in reduction of pimples after using up the entire bottle, I decided not to purchase anymore. Didn't work for me."

This really helped clean my pores and gave my face a nice overall glow.	If you are looking for noticable results and a stronger peel I highly recommend the TCA peel by Skin Laboratory. 15% TCA.	The salicylic peel helped me get prepared for a stronger peel.		Great value and quality"
B000PLUZL8,2009,6,5.0,12,12,87,"Really Works","After years of sun damage and wrinkles forming on my skin, I never thought I could finally find something to help my complexion. Not only did it clear up my acne, but it made my skin feel soft and new. My wrinkles are much less noticeable and my skin looks a lot healthier. Not many products actually work but I'm glad to say that this one did. I'm very happy that I decided to use this product and I recommend it to everyone that wants better skin."
B000PLUZL8,2007,10,5.0,48,58,115,"Best find yet","I didn't purchase it here on Amazon but I have to say this is a great product. It is not for the faint of heart. I have very sensitive skin. I was only able to leave it on for probably less than 30 seconds the first time, the second time putting it on, I could only handle a minute BUT the difference was noticeable the 2nd time. If you can handle the tingling/burning sensation, it really is worth it. I make sure to start with the forehead, then to my chin, upper lip, then my checks as that is the most sensitive for me. There isn't another product like this for such a great price."
B000PLUZL8,2010,6,5.0,37,44,296,"Definitely Worth a Try!","My background: I am very light skinned and in my early thirties. I have oily and sensitive skin with facial acne since high school (many blackheads due to oil & large pores, random small bumps all over my face and infrequent cysts). I have tried countless over the counter and infomercial salicylic acid products for years with ho hum results. (I've always liked how salicylic acid makes the overall appearance of my skin look better. However, in the past I've found that a strong benzoyl peroxide, even though it burns, was better at treating my skin problems.) Also, I have never been to a dermatologist for prescription treatment and have never had a chemical peel mainly due to the costs involved.		That being said, I tried this product for the first time today and already love it! After years of dealing with scrubs and acne products I already know where my sensitive spots are, so I kept the acid away from the area surrounding my mouth. By doing that I was able to keep the product on the rest of my face for a couple minutes with minimal discomfort. (I used a paper towel folded into a triangle to apply and my favorite healing lotion since I couldn't wait to buy gauze and the recommended non-comedonic moisturizer.) I was amazed to watch my blackheads start to ""melt"" away and my pores shrink. (This instant gratification alone makes it worth the price!) I am sure with repeated use (it says 6 treatments for best results) the product will continue to dissolve the small bumps as well and keep away any nasty cysts. This peel impressed me so much it prompted my first ever Amazon review. Thank you for making such a strong and effective salicylic acid available!"
B000PLUZL8,2007,7,5.0,19,21,39,"Outstanding product & price","I love this product!! I have not been able to find anything this strong or at this price anywhere.  My face is always even and beautiful now, this is definately my favorite of the peels skin laboratory puts out."
B000PLUZL8,2012,2,5.0,230,291,303,"Excellent and definitely worth it!","I had pretty good skin to start with but there were some things I wanted to improve. Not only did this product improve the items I wanted to address but it also had some other benefits.		***The texture of the skin in my tear troughs under my eyes was crepe like and would make the concealer look ""cakey"". The skin texture has been dramatically improved. The surprise is that my under eye circles almost invisible now. I don't even need to put on concealer anymore.		***When I smile I would get a bunch of wrinkles under my left eye. There was one deep wrinkle and the other finer wrinkles. Those fine wrinkles are gone and the deep wrinkle is much less noticeable.		***I had orange peel texture on my lower cheeks and around my mouth. Much of this is now gone. The deep texture on my left lower cheek is still there, but significantly improved.		***The skin above my lips looks awesome. My hubby even said ""the skin around your mouth looks great"".		I am now 6 days post peel and my skin is as soft, pink, moist and wrinkle free as a baby's bottom.		I noticed that the first few days, my skin feels a little irritated and sensitive. It is not that bad and is quite normal with any chemical peels out there. But I can definitely notice it as well as a lot of other reviewers on here.		The reason is quite simple, you're removing the outer skin layer so there is more exposure to the thin and sensitive skin underneath.		To stop the sensitivity, I use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z209HS"">Pura D'or Pure & Organic Argan Oil 4 fl. oz.</a> and apply a small amount to it to help form a protecting, moisturizing and healing layer. It works great!		5 stars!		-Susan"
B000PLUZL8,2010,6,5.0,29,34,118,"From an esthetician's point of view...","This peel works great! I used it on my clients and myself and have seen great results. For those who know what they're doing and have used active treatments before, this is a great weekly peel to keep major acne outbreaks at bay and smooth out the skin's surface.		If you're thinking about using this peel and you've never used anything but hand soap on your skin, I would say put the credit card down and do some research before you buy. The treatments really work, but if you haven't built up your skin's ""readiness"" with some home treatments, even over-the-counter acne washes with 2% salicylic, the burning this peel will produce will be too much for you."
B000PLUZL8,2010,11,5.0,14,15,270,"Excelent for Acne!!!","I purchased the salicylic acid about three months ago. If I were to review this product after using it for a month I would definitely give it a bad rating. After using the salicylic acid three times I got a really bad break out. It was probably my fault for leaving it on for about 5 minutes. My skin was all red and there were cystic pimples everywhere on my face. Especially the forehead and around the nose. It took about 3 weeks for these to subside, while I did not use the product. After these three weeks reluctantly I used the peel again, but only left it on for about 2 minutes, every 4 days. Then i increased to about 4 minutes also every 4 days or so. This seems to work perfectly. My skin has never been this clear. I never had a lot of acne, but I have a lot of white heads just under the skin that got infected very easy. This peel will slowly clear your pores and leave your skin more even and acne free. It needs time to work.		  I think its very important to emphasize that initially your very likely to get a bad break out. By giving your skin time to heal, and  a little patience, you can get almost perfect skin. I highly recommend this product, especially to people who have a lot of white heads. Will definitely purchase again.		Ps. - Make sure you use a good and light moisturizer after the peels, otherwise your skin will likely get very dry. I am using Cetaphil and it works great."
B000PLUZL8,2011,6,5.0,17,19,747,"Cleared up my heavy cystic acne","While I had the typical set of pimples in high school, once I reached college and in the throes of my 20's, the acne came full force.  I'm talking huge, pus-filled cysts building up along my face like houses lining up beach-front property.  I didn't help the issue by continually popping them.  Only by reading books, such as this one:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446692417"">The Acne Cure: The Nonprescription Plan That Shows Dramatic Results in as Little as 24 Hours</a>, did I realize that popping them was exploding further bacteria into my skin, which was agitating and increasing the number and volume of cysts I'd deal with.		I didn't want to try Accutane or any other prescription medication.  I had taken monodox (sp?) once, but that left me feeling woozy sometimes and didn't really ""hold"" it's cure. I did use Pro-Active for a time, but that didn't have the strength to battle my problem.  The Acne Cure book suggested a three-step process of salicylic acid, glycolic acid and benzoyl peroxide (BP).  For those who have read the book, many of the products recommended are either hard to find or not around anymore.  In my attempts to find suitable cleansers, from mud bars to sea salts and everything in between, I came across the salicylic acid peel.		To explain:  my skin is oily!  Five minutes will pass by after I wash (with Cetaphil-like cleansers) and the oil resumes.  My mother says I should be happy, as this will stave off major wrinklage, but, whilst I'm in my 30's, I'd like it to be one shade of color until that time.  Also, as a guy, with facial hair trying to come out, my pores have been clogged over the years.  Couple this with the oil and the dirt and the touching of the face and boom--constant acne, with severe cysts.		Back to the peel:  first time around, burn city.  I used a cotton ball and rubbed it all around.  Careful if you have whiteheads that are in the process of bursting.  The acid will sting more and won't provide much help.  I washed it off quickly with some cold water as per the instructions.  At first, I didn't pair it up with the glycolic nor the BP.  After about two days, I noticed mild peeling.  It looked like dried up plastic peeling from being in the sun too long.  (Maybe a touch too graphic, because it wasn't as though it looked like I had dandruff on my face.)  A good, Cetaphil-like lotion quickly took care of that.		See, the salicylic breaks up ""clogged"" or ""gummed"" pores.  It's like Drano for your skin's pipes, clearing out all the gunk and allowing the natural process of your skin to take over.  When I'd look in the mirror, I'd notice smooth or gunked up pieces of skin.  After several uses of the product--my skin tolerated the acid rather well, to the point where I'd leave it on and not wash it off--I noticed that the pores were opening up, the smoothed, lifeless parts of skin were starting to ""breathe"".		Here's the kicker:  it began to ""pull"" out hidden acne; small bumps under my face, that were targeted with a mild red mark were getting bigger.  The acid was neutralizing the bacteria, drawing everything to the surface of the skin and eradicating the enemy.  But, the size and redness did not last as long in the past.  For one, I wasn't popping them anymore and two, I was being patient and letting the medicine to its work.  Not easy to face the public, but the night is darkest just before the dawn!		Once I add the glycolic acid, Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional), paired with either this BP, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00164FKWW"">Acne.org 8 oz. Treatment</a>, or the Pro-Active version, I started to see a reduction in redness, less oiliness, and hair follicles surfacing where there hadn't been any, since they were clogged with dirt and oil.  (Using the 2.5% and the milled process of these BP's is gold.  Anything more than 2.5% and it's just a waste and could possibly dry out your skin.)		I took a break from the routine, but kept up the washing and the BP.  I'm back on it again to clear out the leftover pink spots and to try to get all the pores open to get the full beard in.		So, take this for a test, follow the directions as they're listed.  It worked for me and continues to work."
B000PLUZL8,2011,2,5.0,17,19,260,"A Little about BHAs","This product has done EVERYTHING it claims.  Absolutely less scars, my fine lines are GONE, FIRMER skin, evening out my skin tone.  I am in LOVE with this product.  YES it is harsh and YES it will make you peel.  But it is somewhat controllable.  If you want better results than last time (resulting in more peeling) you leave it one a little longer.  If you peeled too much last time, then leave it on a little shorter (resulting in less peeling).  Pretty basic.  I use this product for 7 minutes.  The peeling (in my case at least) happened two days after use, and lasted for two to three days.  But i am always able to exfoliate it off easily and conceal it easily.  The day after use, your skin feels like a sunburn, a little tight and red.  Then the next night you will see flakes.  But the flakes are very kind and easy to remove.  Then a couple days later when you thought your face was finished shedding, it starts flaking again.  And I'll tell you why: BHAs are different in the fact that they go DEEPER into your pores than AHAs, because they dissolve oil (they LOVE that stuff).  So because it is going deeper, it is going to shed the deeper layers of skin as well as the top layer.  This is why you get better results with Salicylic Acid (BHA) than say Glycolic Acid (AHA).  Definitely try this over ANY AHA. I've used Glycolic and Lactic Acid before and it was more irritating than effective."
B000PLUZL8,2011,10,4.0,10,10,350,"Nice Peel Minus Salon Prices","I have acne brought on by hormonal imbalances. As I'm closing in on 30, I figured this was a time to rejoice from those pesky kid problems. Little did I know!		I had gotten a professional peel a few years ago. It was a mixture of three acids left on the face for no more than 2 minutes. I loved the results. This peel, the Salicylic 20% is not as strong as the professional, but I have been getting similar results.		I have been blessed with large pores (thanks mom!) and I get the dreaded blackheads on my nose. I also get the classic outbreaks around my chin/mouth area and temples. I try to do a peel once a week, sometimes skipping a couple so that my skin can replenish itself appropriately. I leave mine on between 1-3 minutes. I can't take any longer than that. Also, at this concentration, I don't see the need to leave it on much longer.		I've read reviews were some people were leaving this on for 20 minutes or so. DO NOT do this. The insert clearly states no longer than 8 minutes. (There is a reason for this!) Also, I've read where some women (mostly African American) were having pigmentation issues. If you do independent reading on salicylic acid, it can cause hyperpigmentation. Since A.Americans have more pigment in their skin, this is more likely to happen to them. This is not to dissuade you! You know your skin better than anyone else. Just be aware. Also, do not use this product more than once a week...and I would even say no more than twice per month. It is an acid that dissolves skin cells (think...wart remover OTC is 18% salicylic acid). If you continuously remove layers you may put yourself at risk for scarring.		Those are just my warnings to new users. Use this product wisely. It's not a cure-all, but it will help. I also purchased the neutralizer. It feels good after having the sting on your face. An acid should always be neutralized!		I hope you have found this helpful."

This is what happened to me:	1.  Yes, I felt like I built up a tolerance	2.  Yes, I experienced initial redness	3.  Yes, I experienced peeling a few days later	4.  No, I did not find my skin tone evening out or my acne clearing up.  if anything, this seemed to completely confuse my skin, throwing it completely out of wack and triggering more breakouts.	What did work- sticking with a gentle routine of cleaning with a mild ph cleaner and applying an oilfree lotion with 2% salicylic acid.  If anything, I might apply this on a larger zit, but beyond that, I don't think this is the best thing for my entire face.  I think the acid in this is even higher than the wart remover Compund W!"

Generally you must neutralize any acid then remove it with a warm cloth. But i decided to follow the instructions. I left this product on for only about 5 minutes and it was burning my face so i started to put cool water on my face, as i suspected the acid was not coming off and was, in fact, burning even more.		I luckily had a neutralizer product on hand and was able to save my skin. I gave this product 1 star not because it does not work but because the company is selling it to anyone who wants it and they are not giving good and safe instructions on use and removal of this product. It is now 4 days since i have used this product and i have been dealing with some terrible peeling spots on my face. If you decide to purchase this product please also purchase a pH neutralizing product and have it ready so that you can properly remove this acid. Better yet, buy form a reputable company that can give good and accurate instructions."
B000PLUZL8,2011,5,2.0,9,11,729,"Thorougly optimistic but unpleasantly surprised","Before I purchased this item (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PLUZL8"">Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)</a>), I thought I would be a part of the 90% success story I found on Amazon .  This product is an amazing product, but not for me.  I am a biracial (african american/korean) with oily, mild adult acne skin.  I thought I had it bad, but now its worst than ever.		About a month and a half ago, I received this product by mail and relieved that I would get the beautiful skin I used to have when I was  back in my teens.  Since the tender age of 20, I broke out all over my face and there wasn't a product out in the market that could give me the clear skin I have longed for.  I found this product on Amazon and expecting a miracle! Man was I wrong...		The first time I used this product, I followed the instructions to the letter, I washed my face with Cetaphil soap, used a toner, and then the peel.  I only had the product for a minute the first time and I immediately rinsed with cold water.  After,  I mosturized with SPF face lotion and I went on my merry way.  Let me take a moment to add that I used a product called Atralin given to me by the dermatologist.  They told me that all the toxins in my skin will rise up to the surface but in about three months, I will see visibly clear skin.  I stopped using the product after about a week because it burned and made my skin so dry and crusty that I didn't want horrible looking skin.  Well, this product created bumps on either side of my jaw.  They were not pimples, just dirt underneath the skin that was in the process of breaking the surface.  I quit the product before these bumps could form into pimples.		Back to the results, the peel destroyed all the existing pimples a lot quicker than any other acne product on the market.  Furthermore, the bumps I mentioned earlier were now turning into pimples which were going away just as quickly as it would come.  The length of time the peel has been on my face has been increased a minute with each use, and the peel is applied every 5-7 days as recommended.  After the third or fourth peel, I finally saw a glimpse of the beautiful skin I once had! That succes was short lived, the week after, I broke out (still breaking out) with volcanic-like pimples that are ready to erupted.  I paid no attention to the pimples when I first started the peel because there was a stage that reviewers mentioned that it would get worst before it got better.  I am going on my seventh peel and I don't know if I have graduated from that stage yet ???		I have 7 larger pimples, 3 small pimples, and many bumps on my face.  To add insult to injury, my jaw has been covered with scars  from the pimples that erupted on my jawline. The pimples are coming back so fast before the scars would disappear.  I think I could pass for Frankinstein's little sister, twice removed!  By the way, I DID NOT PEEL AT ALL THE ENTIRE TIME USING THE PRODUCT! Which I think was a blessing in disguise or a curse. My face is just getting worst with pimples and multiple scars from those pimples and I am not sure if I've weathered the storm or should I just quit.		If anyone has had similar results like mine and have continued using it  and it eventually got better, please let me know.  I have been avoiding all mirrors as much as possible because I cant stand the sight of my face :0(.  Please NOTE,  the product is producing more pimples than I have ever seen in a lifetime, that is not to say the the peel itself is damaging my face (i.e. chemical burn, spots,  excessive drying, etc.).  Please comment (without insult) of methods or your personal story.  The product does state that it will not always get immediate results and that it make take up to 8th or 9th peels before real results are shown!		Lastly, I hope this review has shined some light on people who are experienceing the same thing as me :0)"
B000PLUZL8,2008,4,5.0,9,11,116,"Works fine for the face","I didn't quite know what to expect when I bought this. After reading instructions I gave it a shot, it burns somewhat but no worse then putting a liquid bandaid on. After three days or so I noticed the top layer of my skin was starting to peel. Week and a half of using it every other day and my skin has peeled twice and returned to normal.		  I can tell the difference, like one reviewer noted yes it doesn't completely get rid of a scar but it did what it was supposed to, blend it in a lot better. Newer scars are completely gone, older one faded just a bit. I would buy this again."
B000PLUZL8,2012,10,5.0,4,4,488,"Works great for me","I have some acne scars and sometimes breakouts.  I have used Salicylic Acid peels in the past with great success.  After the first two times using this product there is a very big difference in the appearance of my face.  I caution everyone because this product should be used EXACTLY as directed, and everyone should try a test spot first.  Everyone's skin is different so a great success for one person may not mean everyone will benefit from this peel.  My face is somewhat resistant to Salicylic Acid because of regular extra strength face washes and creams every day for the past 10 years so I don't turn very red at all when using this mask, and I really don't feel irritation on my face; however, I decided the second time that I used the product to do my upper neck (under my chin) and that area of skin turned bright red for about a day.  After using this product it is important to use some type of non-comedogenic moisturizer with an SPF of 30.  I can't stress that enough.  My experience with most peels, especially salicylic acid, is that it is VERY easy to get sunburn after use even during the winter months.  The moisturizer with SPF 30 is worth using even if you don't think that it is needed.  It is very unpleasant to get sunburn/extra irritation to a recently treated area of your skin.		This peel can also be used for reasons other than your face, but you should avoid using it in large quantities, over large areas of skin, or too frequently.  In the past I had noticed headaches and upset stomachs when I used too much salicylic acid.  If you're unsure about the peel or if you become overly sensitive to the peel it may be best to talk with a dermatologist, but the most important thing is to follow the instructions EXACTLY.  Also, use a face peel brush to apply and not your hands.  It is important to have control over where the gel is applied, and letting using your hands will likely lead to skin irritation and drying on your hands.  Face peel brushes are pretty cheap and they are fan brushes so it is easy to control the application and get the peel on evenly and fast to avoid an uneven result.		Overall I feel this is an AMAZING product that is very cost effective.  When I don't use the peels I use face washes and lotions to prevent breakouts and reduce scars, but the face washes and lotions easily cost me over $80 per month.  I still have to use moisturizing lotions and other products each month, but when I use this peel I am only spending about $10 per month for face wash and lotion, and I have found that this size bottle of peel is good for a few months.  I think this is a great buy."
B000PLUZL8,2012,10,5.0,4,4,380,"YOU SHOULD BUY THIS!!!","I love this stuff, I really do. I was looking at my skin this morning and almost cried because I never thought my skin would look so normal. I have had horrible acne since I was 10 and I am now 30. A few months ago I developed the worst hormonal breakouts along  my jawline. I had 20 + cystic zits at a time. I found this online and ordered it because of the reviews, though I must admit some sounded too good to be true. I purchased some witch hazel and cotton balls and always  use that first. My first application I only left on for two minutes. Which is fine, please don't have the warrior mentality about this stuff because I honestly believe that you get better results by gradually easing into it. After rinsing with lots of water I apply Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer with SPF 30.  This is a great sunscreen/moisturizer to followup with as it has a little skin tone evening/ brightening effect and it smells so nice and fresh. I do not wash my face with any harsh cleansers the day I do the ""peel"". I did this routine once a week for one month and all of my pimples and deep zits cleared up. Completely. In between treatments, I wash my face ever day with an Oil of Olay ProX  using Olay Total Effects Blemish Control Salicylic Acid Acne Cleanser with it. I spend a good two minutes letting it work its way all over my face. I follow up with the Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer. Sometimes if my skin gets a little dirty feeling I'll swab some witch hazel on my face. That's it. Really low maintenance. Now I do the peel once a month. My skin looks so much better. I know I can't promise results because everybody is different but I know that it worked for me and I had tried everything. Since I started using this I have not gotten a single cystic acne flare-up and have probably only had about 5 or so little pimples here and there that came the day after wearing BB cream or powder. So, buy it, its so worth it and I haven't even used half the bottle yet. You can't beat that!"

I use cotton swabs to dab over my face and let it sit for about 2-4 minutes at MOST and it burns so good.		I then use cold water and flush out the chemical peel.

B000PLUZL8,2012,1,5.0,4,4,348,"Skeptic Turned Believer!","Every time I read reviews saying ""It's a miracle"" or ""Best product ever"", I'm skeptical.  Usually because it doesn't work for me.  Ever.  I'm 30 years old and after going off birth control permanently last year I've started getting horrible breakouts along my chin and jawline.  Like everyone else, i've tried everything!  Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5% has worked, sorta, but it makes my skin dry, dull and ugly. I used this peel two nights ago - the burning was intense, duh.  Also, I've read enough about chemical peels to know that you really should rinse with a neutralizer. I filled my sink with cold water and mixed in a couple tablespoons of baking soda and used that to rinse.  Thank god I did!  It took the burn away immediately.  I was only able to tolerate the salicylic for about 2.5 minutes.  Redness afterwards was minimal and went away within about 15 minutes. The next morning my skin looked radiant and smooth.  The 3 or 4 chin and jawline pimples were dried up and I didn't feel oily at all - a huge improvement.  My skin continued to improve throughout the day - I could almost feel the peel continuing to work.  I figured the improvements I saw the first day would be the extent of it's power.  That is, until I woke up this morning (day 2).  Wow.  Red marks and scars on my cheeks with significantly lighter, skin looked even MORE radiant and all active blemishes were GONE!  I didn't wear makeup today.  That's a first.  I had a little peeling on my chin but it disappeared with some cetaphil moisturizer.		I'm sold.  Can't wait to use this product again!  For me to take the time out of my ridiculously busy life to leave a review for this product speaks for itself.  I don't leave feedback, ever.  But I had to share this with anyone struggling with acne, scarring or uneven skin tones.  This stuff works!  I'm so happy!		I will update this review in a month with my progress.  I can't wait to see the ""new"" me!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,7,5.0,4,4,294,"Burns skin off like acid","It's not like real acid in the movies (good thing for me) but it does burn like crazy some times. I have rosacea and the really bad kind. I havent had it for long, although I'm already highly sensitive to almost everything. This stuff, as I said burns and tingles, but when the procedure is done - my skin feels amazing! It does make it red which is why you should use it at night and not before work.		Application: I highly suggest you get a cotton swab for this, put over bottle, tip for a second or two then DAB not wipe on face. Replinish the cotton swab as needed, you don't want a lot on your face but you do want enough to make it work. When it's time to rinse your face, very carefully rinse over and over and over again for a couple minutes. If this stuff stays on your skin by accident, it can have gnarly consequences. The rest of the procedure is explained with the bottle itself..I just wanted to dumb it down a little.		Also, for the love of god do not use this all the time. I read one person using this several times a day, the damage to your skin could be astronomical. I read from a medical journal that you can actually become poisoned from using this too much. I use it twice a week which is more than safe and does the job.		Finally, if it burns too much then rinse right away. A some burn is good because it's actually removing your dead skin which of course doesn't feel good. Use sunscreen!!! You are pretty much making your skin naked to the atmosphere and the sun so as suggest 35 or above."
B000PLUZL8,2011,1,5.0,1,1,57,"this is magic","Even the burn in this is great. Really, it's not like it burns your face and you can't stand it, it's more like a ""this is kicking the ass of all my pimples"" burn.

B000PLUZL8,2011,0,5.0,1,1,107,"Excellent peel","Use this once a week and I guarantee you'll have smoother skin in less than a month.  However, do not give in to the idea that keeping this gel peel on your skin for more than the recommended high of 8 minutes will get better results -- this stuff is potent, so start out keeping it on for one or two minutes at most, then work your way up to the longer treatment.  You will experience slight stinging after application and that's entirely normal.  I will be using this product on a weekly basis from now on. Scaley, rough patches on my cheeks have almost entirely disappeared."
B000PLUZL8,2011,0,5.0,1,1,100,"Great product!","This product is really fantastic. It can be quite uncomfortable at first, but, it really seems to do the trick. I had pretty much the worst breakout of my entire life, and this stopped it in its tracks. I have done this peel three times in about two weeks and I have barely had any breakouts at all, maybe one pimple every five days. Also, the pimples that do show up are very small and almost invisible when I put makeup over it. I don't know if this will work long term or not, but, for now, it's pretty fantastic!"

I was skeptical at first, and did have some redness and dry skin the first few times I used it.	Now my skin has adjusted to it and im using it about once a week.	My skin has never looked better and been so clear.	This product doesn't seem to have much effect on skin discoloratiom, I plan on purchasing the glyco/lax peel to take care of that.

B000PLUZL8,2010,8,5.0,1,1,185,"Gradual but effective","I've been using this product for about two weeks now, though not on a regular schedule.  The first day I got it, I used it for two consecutive days.  I try to use it about every three days depending on the dryness of my skin.  When I first used it, it burned very badly and I left it on for a minute.  Initially, I saw no changes in the clearness of my skin and it actually made my skin very dry at first, then very oily even when using a good moisturizer.  There was quite a bit of peeling on my nose after the first couple uses and I wouldn't recommend wearing makeup after using this unless you want to look cakey and flaky.  I typically use it on Fridays and leave it on for the maximum 8 minutes then let my skin recover over the weekend.  My skin looks quite a bit clearer with a few minor cystic blemishes here and there.  Overall, I would recommend this product.  It works better than most other acne products I've tried.  Just be patient and persistent. :)"
B000PLUZL8,2010,8,4.0,1,1,74,"Nice Product and waaay cheaper than the professionals","I decided to order this product after spending way too much money on professional chemical peels. The product is exactly what I wanted. I have had some very light peeling and i feel like my skin has improved after a couple weeks of use. Hopefully, it will continue to as time goes on. my only issue with this product is the unclear directions. There are multiple places where the information on application frequency varies."

I've tried Proactive, Natures Cure, everything in the face washing section and nothing has worked until this peel. This product has dramatically decreased breakouts, cleaned and shrunk my pores, and helped my overall skin tone.		If you are a beginner, start off with the 20% solution and buy a skin Neutralized/pH balance. I use cotton balls to apply both the Peel and the Neutralizer.		First week: I applied twice that week giving a few days in between applications. Because I didn't know how my skin would react, I left the Peel on for only 2 minutes (this is plenty for the first few times).		Second week and On: I began increasing the time by 2 minutes every so often. Now I'm at 8 minutes per peel and still only using it twice per week.		This chemical peel is a remarkable product that is worth the time, money and a little pain."

Having a 2% content is not enough, as in some face washes (Clinic). Don't waste your money on expensive products. I started using regular Dove soap and Cetaphil wash, and salicylic acid twice a week at first, and it's all that's need to clear the face. The initial break out was ferocious. I stayed home for two weekends feeling like I got the plague, which made me very depressed. The problems went away and the texture of the sking is still getting better (pores are smaller)."

I've been using this off and on (from once a week at the start to once or twice a month now)since August and I like it.  I have some hyperpigmentatin from past cystic acne which this hasn't done anything to clear up but I haven't gotten any more large pimples since I started this peel which is awesome. Any pimples that I do get tend to go away faster than they used to. My skin feels so smooth after I rinse. I'm considering the glycolac for my next purchase to get rid of the old dark marks.		Note:  I started off applying this with a fan brush but now I just tip my fingers over the top and use them to spread the peel.  The product lasts a lot longer this way because it's not soaking into the brush. But be careful, you are really NOT supposed to rub it into your skin. It burns after about 2-3 min and then I rinse in the shower.  Wash your face first then follow with toner to remove excess oil which helps the peel to penetrate your pores. There is usually no redness after unless I had any frosty areas which then turn brown and peel after a few days with no residual scarring beneath.		Also, I have milia around my nose and on my chin which it hasn't gotten rid of completely but it is much easier to extract after this peel. Definitely worth the money."

Sometimes it also helps to cover them with a spot bandaid after the gel has been applied.

The first and most important thing I can express with peels of this nature(glycolic, salicylic, and lactic) is that you need to be PATIENT. This is not a miracle overnight cure for hyperpigmentation, acne, enlarged pores, scaring, and superficial wrinkles and lines. It will make these problems MUCH better with time.	I have mild acne and some clogged pores and the winter season makes my face flakey red, and more prone to breakouts, especially not being in the sun, pool and tanned all the time. I was looking everwhere for something to work. After a lot of research I started trying the lactic acid peels, which are very moisturizing. I wanted to combat the dry flakey skin first. I tell you what I BROKE OUT LIKE CRAZY. I was so upset, but I kept at it. One peel a week, or sometimes less if I felt I needed it. Soon, my skin started looking a lot better, smoother, and the tone was more even. It also hurt less to put on the peel. So I decided to try this peel. WOW EVEN BETTER. My skin has never looked so good. I use the peel about once every three days, but I only leave in on for 1-2 mins at a time before i rinse. Then I follow up with amlactin (a lactic acid moisturizer) with a few drops of hyaluronic acid. If I am having more acne issues I will follow up the salicylic acid peel with Benzoyl peroxide, but nothing more than 3% or it is too drying. I think someone with the same skin situation as me would really benefit from this product and for the really great price, its worth its weight in gold. I will be a repeat customer for sure."
B000PLUZL8,2010,9,5.0,3,3,140,"Not only for acne.","I don't have acne, I have a different skin condition, Keratosis pilaris, so I decided to give this a try, because as many have mentioned, for the price you really have nothing to lose. It has definitely decreased the redness that comes with this, which is awesome because I'm not particularly fond of looking like I'm blushing all the time. It is also reducing the bumps on my face which is also fantastic. I have noticed a slight increase in zits (and I mean slight as in one or two zits every two or three weeks), but many reviews say this will subside, and I believe them. Plus, since this dries out skin, the zits are gone in about four days so it certainly doesn't bother me. I've been using this for about a month and definitely would recommend it."
B000PLUZL8,2010,5,5.0,3,3,262,"Dramatic Improvement in My Skin","The item was carefully packed and got here before the scheduled arrival date.  Kudos to the seller!  Anyway, I never had problems with acne when I was a teenager; however, I turned about 25 and bam, I suddenly have blackheads and pimples.  The blackheads are most bothersome because they're exceptionally noticeable on my nose and chin.  I have tried every scrub out there to no avail.		Then I purchased this peel.  I've never tried one before in my life so it was a novel experience.  I will say that the first time I used it, there was significant discomfort.  IE, it felt like someone was holding a blow torch to my face.  The mask stayed on for only a minute.  I got a little bit of redness, a little puffiness, but no peeling.  I followed up with an oil free moisturizer.  When I woke up in the morning, many of the blackheads had decreased in size or disappeared.  Per the instructions, I waited 7 days and went back at it.  This time, I was able to leave it on for about 3 minutes.  My face is seriously peeling and now, there's not a blemish on my face.  I've been cleansing, toning, and moisturizing the same as I always do.		I would say that this product has been miraculous for me.  I know the results aren't permanent; nothing is.  But this is something I'm willing to add to my weekly skin care regimen because the results have been so dramatic.  Even the women I work with have been complimenting me on my skin."
B000PLUZL8,2010,3,5.0,3,3,1058,"Nice strong peel for first time peelers","I'm 37 and have had acne since age 9 and still do. I have been a smoker for 18 years (quit 3 months ago-wish me luck), so obviously this has taken a toll on my skin. I have been using Retin-A since I was 16 years old. I have dark marks where previous acne has been. I have a few tiny dent-type scars that blend into my smile lines mostly. I also developed ""melasma"" 3 years ago...SUDDENLY when I was on a Caribbean cruise (obviously in the sun). Even though I had been using VERY high SPF and very water/sweat proof, on my face for many years...and was wearing it FULL TIME on this trip...it still appeared and never went away. It is less noticeable when I haven't been in the sun for a very long time (winter time), but even with high SPF it still appears MUCH DARKER as soon as the sun hits my face and doesn't go away at all during summer months. I also have had very dark circles under my eyes for many years due to my olive skin complexion. I also have had redness around my nostrils and on my chin for the past 7 years. 7 years ago a derm told me that the red stuff was also sun damage (I was expecting a rosacia diagnosis). I have also had large pores for a long time especially on my nose and chin...but they all look big to me. I also still have an oily T-zone.		Ever since I developed the melasma 3 years ago I have been searching for a cure that I could afford but I never found anything. My wrinkles and acne I have learned to live with...not happily but as a matter of nature. After researching I knew that the only fixes would be expensive salon or derm procedures. So I gave up and tried to embrace my new marks all over my face...(ARE YOU KIDDING?). I have not been able to do this so THANK GOD I RAN INTO THE REVIEWS OF THESE PRODUCTS ON AMAZON!!! I'm SOOOOO EXCITED!!!		I purchased THIS peel, the Lactic 35% & Glycolic 25% Combo Gel Peel, the HQ+ (to use in the future - once I have a tolerance to peels), and the pH balancer. The balancer is worth the [...] bucks!!! I did buy all but the ph balancer @ [...] because it was a tiny bit cheaper and I like the applicator gauze that they sell which I couldn't find on Amazon. It is only [...] bucks for 200 and they are perfect for this use! More sanitary than using a brush over and over also. They are not very absorbent so you don't feel like the gauze is sucking up/wasting the product.		5 days ago I got the purchase in the mail. I used the Salicylic first because it was a Saturday and I therefore knew I would have a little healing time, if needed. This Salicylic 20% was stronger than the Lactic 35% & Glycolic 25% Combo Peel. Today is Sunday (a week later) and I just used the combo peel.		So, I put this mask on and could only leave it on for 20 seconds.  The feeling I had around my nostrils (the most sensitive part of my face) caused me to remove it. I KNOW that the peel was effective even in that short of a dose.  Both masks make pores smaller IMMEDIATELY! Especially the biggest ones so THAT IS AWESOME!!! My skin felt/feels and looks very smooth, clean, brighter and tighter than prior to using (experience after using both peels). I can't wait to work my way up to the HQ+ since that is the one that is for ""dark marks"". This Salicylic peel did make my darker areas of my face look a tiny bit brighter (including the redness, scaring, under eye circles and the melasma). This shocked me in a wonderful way, because this peel isn't supposed to improve these things specifically. I had a mild breakout on my chin and forehead after this peel in areas I always have acne (about 3 days after using the peel) therefore I'm assuming that it was acne already underlying my skin that the peel ""brought out"". I'm used to this when ever I restart Retin-A so I'm not worried about it continuing. I had some redness and peeling only on my most sensitive areas of my face about 36-48 hours after using the peel. This only lasted for a day and was very mild.  There was one tiny place that a thick piece of skin came off but I didn't know it was there until it peeled off (happened to the area that ""stung"" most when peel was on).  Today when I applied the combo peel I applied all over my face without putting it around my nostrils and left the peel on for 3 times longer than I was able to leave it on around my nose.  From now on I will apply this way: face first, then sensitive areas for reduced time.  I wouldn't have guessed properly exactly where my sensitive areas were before using the peel all over so just try it out the first time and wash it all off as soon as one area has been stinging for a couple of seconds.  This way you will have a gauge for what areas to be most careful with. I am looking forward to using this peel again and leaving it on full face for longer.  I am guessing that I'm going to like the results of this peel better than the combo peel because it is stronger and my face can handle it...but only time will tell. I was able to leave the combo peel on for 5 minutes on non-sensitive areas. I was shocked after starting with this peel.  I would have even left the combo peel on longer had it not been my first use of it. I DO SUGGEST THE PH BALANCER ALSO!!! I have been using Cetaphil moisturizer since it is so benign.		I'll post an update in a month or so. Happy peeling!!!! Read the directions and don't worry!!! Just make sure you have a very warm and wet washcloth waiting for you in the sink before you start and you won't have a problem."
B000PLUZL8,2010,3,5.0,3,3,325,"Finally!! the search is over!","I've used everything to get rid of my adult acne. My skin is combination so I have dry spots and oily spots and frequent breakouts. I'm also getting fine lines. Every anti aging cream has made me break out and every acne medication has made my wrinkles worse. I thought I was a lost cause...until i stumbled on this! Wonderful stuff. I applied the first treatment for 2 minutes, it had started to sting a bit at about the 2 minute mark so I rinsed well with cool water and the stinging stopped. Immediately my pores were tightened, NO redness what so ever. Skin looked slightly firmer after one treatment, and every single one of my blemishes had shrank. The redness on my zits was reduced also. By day two, my skin had broke out slightly again but I reapplied the peel on day 3 for another 2 minutes and the results were even better! skin is so baby smooth! acne was ""zapped"" immediately and fine lines were less. Didnt have another post treatment breakout after that. Every single day my skin looks better. I cant even imagine what it will do for me after the recommended 6 treatments for full results!! I'm so excited about this! After 2 treatments my old acne scars are even fading, and old blackheads that have been embedded forever suddenly ""popped"" out!! I cant find a single blackhead on my face. amazing! I'm recommending to all my friends. My neighbor commented on how great my face looked on day 3. I told her my secret! after 3 days I look like I did 3-5 years ago (wrinkle wise) i cant wait for the full results :) finally something for aging skin that has teenage acne! It is drying, so put on lots of a non clogging cream. I'm using a vit e cream that has no pore clogging mineral oil in it. seems to work well with the peel."
B000PLUZL8,2010,2,5.0,3,3,109,"Immediate, noticeable improvement","My middle-age skin was in need of a wake-up. I hadn't had a professional facial in about 4 months, and I really didn't want to drop $100 on another, so I tried this. Good choice for immediate results.		My main issues -- congested skin, big pores. I saw immediate improvement after only two applications for a minute or so. I was definitely in need of help, and this product helped. It also is helped to heal a cystic pustule. The only time I saw such immediate improvement on one of these was when I resorted to steroidal shots to heal a nagging one.		Money well spent in my opinion."
B000PLUZL8,2011,5,5.0,2,2,61,"good stuff for beginners","I've been using this for a couple of weeks now and I am extremely please with results. I'm already noticing that my acne scars are fading and my skin appears more clear and toned. Very happy with the purchase. This product is great for beginners, the tingle was still very intense - I couldn't imagine starting out with a higher concentration."
B000PLUZL8,2011,4,5.0,2,2,465,"Finally A Serious Product to Get Serious Results!!!","Problem:	Slight redmarks/leftover spots from shoulder acne		Attempts:	Tried tanning indoors and outdoors.  It only left me with darker spots and unhealthy burned/tanned skin.	AHA cream.  Left my shoulders oily and my clothes stained.	BP cream.  Destroyed several shirts from the bleaching.	Nothing.  Did nothing lol.	Those scar removal patches.  It sucks that they are expensive and the results are negligible at best.		Solution:	Got in this as it is serious for serious results.  The first time I put it on 8 minutes.  I usually alternate between shoulders in case I get a bad reaction and don't go sleepless from the irritation on my back.  I have been doing it 2x a week per shoulder area.  Since the skin on the shoulders is a lot thicker than on the face, I've left it up to 20 minutes.  That 20 minutes burned lol but my marks are fading quicker than ever.  I have some raised scarring that is fading also for the first time from these peels.  My method is using a Q-Tip and dabbing it over the area and try to cover the ""shoulder pads"" of the shoulders.  Just imagine the area football shoulder pads go on.  The redness disappears within a few hours and the peeling occurs the next couple of days.		My only complaint is that I didn't get the 100mL version!  I will next time!		Update 1: 11-22-11 - Been using this since I got the 30 mL.  Like I said above my only complaint was not getting 100 mL.  Well I am on the 100 mL now and still maintaining use 2-3 times a week on my shoulders only.  I read that others have had issues with their face from this product.  I tried it on chin one night and it burns like crazy after a few seconds.  I wouldn't recommend using it on the face but that is just me.  There are many less irritating things to use.  For shoulders though, the skin is much thicker and traditional creams and methods just don't penetrate well enough.  My shoulders are still slowly fading.  I am patient because I used to have acne on the face and it took a few years for that to clear up completely scars and all.  It just takes patience and understanding what is going on.  The way I think of it, when you use this, you speed up the exfoliating/healing process by constantly burning away old skin and bringing in new skin.  I did it on my face with less burning methods and my shoulders are following.  I predict all the marks on my shoulders will be completely gone within 1 year.  How do I know?  Because my right shoulder is nearly clear and that stopped breaking out about a year before my left stopped.		Cheers!!!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,4,5.0,2,2,381,"Third Purchase of Salicylic Acid 20%","When I first started using the Professional gel peels my skin became dry and flaky, and would flake for days at times.  It also brought out the pus deep in my skin, making me breakout more.  I don't think this step in the process can be avoided, with any brand!!  BUT...		Better days DO come!! I promise.  I feel that the way my skin reacted is a probably a pretty normal skin reaction.  Best thing you can do, which will hopefully minimize the ""cleansing"" time your skin will take... acquaint your skin to their level 1 peels (salicylic acid, glycolic acid 35%, etc.) before moving to level 2.  When I first started using their gel peels I was mixing in a level 2 peel while my skin was still adjusted to a level 1 peel.  I feel that alone increased my duration for having ""scaly"" skin and breakouts.  Also, I don't think I could have exfoliated enough!!  Exfoliation will be your best friend. :)		Now, I have reached the point where my skin no longer breaks out when I use the different level of peels.  I do still notice some flaky skin, but nothing that is noticeable and a nice scrub can't take care of.  I am in my early-20s and never had a serious problem with my acne until the beginning of college (when I was 17).  My breakouts kept getting worse and worse and nothing seemed to work.  I tried the major infomercials cures for acne, went to a dermatologist, researched online, etc.  Nothing seemed to permanently  get rid of my acne and leave me with a clean-looking face!  It became even more frustrating when I started using their gel peels, but I was determined to stick it out for 3-months after reading other reviewers with this same scaly problem.  Clear days started coming after many frustrating days.  My skin has stayed clear (of course with the occasional breakout/pimple every now and then) for about a year now.  Even though I have had the occasional breakout they have not been as severe as they were, which alone has been life-changing.  Just make sure to find a good moisturizer (or two... or three...) that you feel comfortable using daily... morning and night, and every time after you use their peel."
B000PLUZL8,2011,4,4.0,2,2,207,"It works only at begining of every phase","Since I do not study chemistry, I can not understand how this product worked. I got acne suddenly this year may be because I always stay up late and have great pressure(I have never had acne before). The acne is quite serious. The first time I used this peel, I felt my face was burnt. I only let it stay on my face for 30 seconds. Supprisingly, the next two days, the acne became dead. I continued to use it for about 3days. Then used it again the next week. The face did not react as strong as the first time. I let the peel stay on the face for 5 minutes. I continued to use this peel for a month, once/week, the acne was kept in a stable situation, which was not totally removed, but not serious as before. Later, my friends recommanded me Body Shop acne remove mask. Then I stopped using peel for two weeks. But at the begining of the third week, my acne sudenly tended to serious as a month ago. I began to use peel again. And my face reacted as strong as I first time used it. I guess I can not leave it until my life style become healthy."

I love the results, I peel once a week and will taper off to once a month soon. My pores are nearly non-visible, my face is so smooth and soft. There is very ,very little discomfort if you can even call it that. Rinse very well with cool water and apply the lotion they suggest. I love this product and will continue to use it forever!!!

I was desperate to find something to help me get rid of my acne and I came across this product. I have only used it 4 times and WOW! What a difference it has made already. My face is clearing up finally. I only wish I had found this sooner. Surprisingly it has not dried out my face however the first time I used it, I did break out, but it cleared up quickly. My only suggestion would be to do the first application when you have no plans to be anywhere just in case you break out like I did. The breakout quickly went away and my skin is looking better every day!		UPDATE: I have been using this now for about 3 weeks. After several uses, I did start to peel and my face was dry in certain parts (especially my chin, around my nose, and at my temples). My face was a bit of a disaster for a few days - some pimples mixed with dry skin but I found an amazing fix and my skin looks! Use a little bit of vaseline (yes sounds weird I know but I googled this) on the really dry parts (just a thin layer). Also, if you add a little vaseline to your moisturizer, your skin will be amazing in the morning (no dryness and no pimples)!"

It does tingle a little bit but I followed the time for each peel and I'm up to the 4th peel now and my husband and friends remarked how smooth and pretty my skin looks. I'm going to keep with it and work up to the 8 min. max time allotment. I have a very oily t-zone and I highly recommend that you use a nice potent moisturizer (natural of course) to soothe & keep your skin from revolting.  I allow at least 3 days between peels, use the highest SPF for the face you can get your hands on, (I use AVEENO for the face spf 70), be vigilant about wearing a hat.  So far it's been easy, subtle and gratifying."

But the consecutive times i first clean my skin of all dirt and oils by swiping it with rubbing alcohol and then apply the peel. It works so much better and I dont leave it on past 3 mins cuz the burn is more intense. I have used so many products to try to control my acne (moderate) but nothing until this has come close!!!I actually purchase this along with some emu oil so after the peel i use a tiny amount to keep the skin moisturized ( a little goes a long way).

After I would apply it, my whole face would start rapidly heating up and it is a bit to endure, but the results are well worth it! I've used it about once or twice a week for the past three weeks now and my scarring has tremendously gone down and my skin feels extremely smooth.

I mean it was truly unbearable but after that first application; a few days later, 3 days to be exact i noticed some peeling around my chin area. I was excited as i thought that It would peel the rest of the dead skin from my face. As i continued using this product and my tolerance level became longer, i noticed that i was not peeling as i did with first application and my cheeks are the problem areas with spots scattered about. I don't know if it is peeling slightly and I am not aware because I do notice that the spots are fading a bit but i use another cream on my face at night so it could be that as well but my pores have shrunk a tiny bit. I continue to use this product with the hopes that i will be blemish free or at least close to it.

I don't think I'd want to see the total amount of money I've spent trying to find something to combat this annoying skin ailment during the past two years.		This was kind of my last test on trying to correct my face. As expected, I saw no results from this product. I've used this about three weeks, and I did not expect some dramatic miracle, but seeing nothing positive happen is just a disappointing. Only reason I gave it two stars is because it didn't damage my face or produce any bad side effects. It just had no effect at all, positive or negative. My tolerance to the stinging sensation grew quickly, and I did not go through any peeling. Acne didn't subside, it just carried on its normal routine. My blackheads remained and my pores did not seem smaller after use either.		These products make me consider going into the skincare business. As a single consumer, I've spent hundreds on facial products that produce no results. It's a great industry to make money I bet.

I tried again the following Tuesday and I had received my brush that I ordered. I used it instead and I felt a major difference. It began burning immediately. I was able to distract myself for 10 minutes. I didn't get red but I didn see the white spots that others spoke about. I used the neutralizer and my skin was so smooth. I also noticed that I only had a shinny nose where my entire face is usually oily. I think if I keep using it twice a week, I will see more results and the bumps will completely clear. I'm satisfied.

I first used it in a few spots on my face (nose, cheek) where I was having small mini breakouts. A minute or two with it on, I was shocked to look into the mirror and see all kinds of major GUNK coming out of my pores. It was as if the product hit the ""evacuate"" button and all hands were on deck to help with the purging :P		The next spot was my arm. When I previously went with the dermatologist, it took honestly at least a year to see the SLIGHTEST improvement in my skin with my arms being the toughest spots. 4 minutes with this product on left my arm feeling much smoother. It will be a spot that will need repeat applications for sure but I was very encouraged by all results so far.		WARNING:This is a wonderful product but like everything else in life, it's not idiot proof. Read the directions!!!"

B000PLUZL8,2012,1,5.0,0,0,188,"Jack's ma","Finally!  I have tried every OTC product I could find and sought help from several dermatologists.  Nothing worked well or had lasting results until I tried the peel.  This stuff is amazing.  Acne and blackheads were greatly diminished with the first use, fine lines were less noticeable, sun spots faded, and skin texture was more smooth and firm. Each use provides noticeable improvement and the gains continue days after the treatment.  This product costs little in terms of time, money, and effort.  Start with the shortest time recommended and gradually build up so you don't have chemical burns and look like you just stepped out of an inferno.  Follow all directions and begin with the shortest time suggested-this is a powerful product!  Product was packaged well and arrived at my home in just a few days.  I would highly recommend this product, but suggest you do a patch test and follow directions to avoid pain and embarrassment.  The only drawback is the slight skin bleaching effect. The treated skin was lighter the the skin on my neck after each use. The great results outweigh this one small downside."
B000PLUZL8,2012,1,5.0,0,0,367,"I ordered this with two other products","I ordered this along with SkinLaboratories 35% Lactic Acid Peel and their 35% Glycolic Acid Peel. I have only used this one and the Glycolic acid peel thus far but let me tell you, do NOT let the percentages deceive as to how much of a wallop these products pack when it comes to the ""tingling sensation"". I have had problem skin all my life (I am 21 now and started having acne at 8-so much fun) and as a result I have used my fair share of prescription grade and drug store grade products. That being said I am on week two of using these items and I am seeing quite a bit of progress. The first week I used this product once a day everyday for about a minute, yes it does burn but as soon as you wash it off you can visibly see where it is doing its magic. Furthermore in order to sooth my skin every night after doing this I would slather it in Jojoba Oil and really rub it in like a gentle massage. Yes, your face will be red after you use it but the redness does fade by the next morning. Your skin will feel tight and it will peel (literally) but it will not be painful it is comparable to just speeding up the rate at which dead skin sloughs off. For me the dry patches were my forehead, chin, and around my nose area-interestingly the oiliest parts of my face. Another thing, your skin WILL break out when you use this seems discouraging believe me I know however it takes about two weeks for your skin to purge itself when you start a skin regime that is as intense as this. I also use and ultrasonic cleansing tool on a daily basis and no my skin is not irritated or raw. I do not expect instant results simply because I have prior experience with multiple skin regimes however compared to the result times I have gotten used to (2-3) months this one is working out rather well. This week I have been using the Glycolic acid peel so I suppose I will leave feedback about that."

At first I used it once a week, but now it's more like once every 2-3 weeks. It's no miracle, but it works for me and will continue to be a part of my beauty regimen."
B000PLUZL8,2012,7,5.0,73,77,158,"effective and cost effective for acne scars","I have used this product once a week for the past three months.  I have had problem skin for years, very oily and frequent break outs.  I purchased this product for the scars the acne leaves since I heard it works great for this purpose.  While it hasn't completely eliminated the scars, it does peel some skin off the scar, and has made them almost invisible.  Not quite gone, but barely noticeable anymore.		For past six weeks or so I have also been using retinol cream, Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 Oz. + FREE Blemish Roll-On Stick with Tea Tree Oil.  I have been applying it every night and lately my skin has not only cleared up but also looks and feels much smoother than it has been for awhile.  The combination of these products are working wonders for my skin, and for the low cost, it would be my first recommendation for anyone with skin problems"
B000PLUZL8,2011,3,5.0,55,57,373,"Good stuff","I'm a 33 year old suffering from acne for the last 15 years or so with some minimal ice pick scarring on my cheeks. I've tried everything from meds,prescribed topical solutions, 100s of face washes, homopathic natural approach etc etc. Nothing seemed to work for me. Bought this 20% solution about 2 weeks ago and gave it a try.		The 1st time I applied this stuff on my entire face which was a bad idea. I started on my forehead and by the time I got it applied to the rest of my face I was 2 minutes in on my forehead but only 1 minute in on my cheeks which made it difficult to time and to have it work evenly. Alot of ""frosting"" occured on the sensitive parts of my face such as cheek bones just under the eyes, my nose and around my mouth. For 2 days my face was severely red in those areas it looked like I got a black eye or a good beating. My sensitive areas peeled quite a bit and underneath revealed very smooth, perfect lookin skin. My Ice Pick scarring looked slightly less deep after 1 peel too.		On a side note my acne actually got worse on my forehead before it got better. I guess that has to do with the toxins coming to the surface? I suggest applying this peel to your forehead and jaw 1st because those areas can withstand a longer burn, wash off, THEN apply this stuff to your sensitive areas 1 at a time ( below the eyes,nose,around mouth) or you'll seriously burn yourself like I did.		Also the  instructions said to wash off with plenty of water but maybe a PH neutralizer would be better. My face start to burn and frost over and I will dump my entire face into icecold water in the tub and it still continues to burn for 20-30 seconds after. So if you dont have a PH neutralizer I'd suggest washing this stuff off BEFORE you reach the painful point.		Also I'd like to add in that I never take the time to write reviews but this peel worked so good I had to share it with everyone. Good luck guys!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,3,5.0,64,68,836,"It's a Process, note the capital P","I've used this product for over four months, once a week; additionally, both my sisters and one of my brothers have used the product a couple of times.  15 uses? Pshaw. 20 at least...unless you have an exceptionally large face?		The first time you use this product if you can manage 2 minutes you are a super hero.  If you manage that much without crying you have exceptional tear ducts and/or pain tolerance. However, every time afterwards is exponentially easier to handle till 8 minutes is not big deal. Persevere!		Right from the first use I noticed a radical decrease in pore size (look in a close up mirror 10 minutes after peel and again in the morning to note change), that it was easier to extract goop from my pores and that any cream or treatment worked more effectively proceeding a peel.  I happen to have exceptionally large pores pretty much all over my face, asian american, but regular use of this product has made my pores appear less sunken in and smaller.  Plus, my skin is tighter and smoother, on my forehead especially.		There was definitely some redness and dry skin the first time I used it on myself, but that also diminished with every use.  Though that also could have to do with perfecting MY PROCESS:		1. Wash face really well, either with my SkinSonic or just in the shower		2. Tone with Witch Hazel (tried this with just alcohol a few times and that adds more redness recovery time)		3. Apply product with a cotton ball evenly all over face using a q-tip to get around the nose and lips precisely		4. Sit for 8 minutes (or however long you can stand if you're on first few uses) and read something distracting		5. Splash face with really cold water for a full minute		6. Take a pinch of baking soda mixed with water to makes a runny paste and apply all over face (one can of course buy a neutralizer if one is so inclined, but I highly recommend this step.  Yes, it will sting to apply the baking soda; every times you do it, at the same pain level.  However, after a few brief but intense seconds, the pain will fade entirely- which I find it will not do otherwise- and if I do it at night, the next morning, no redness and I'm good to go for make-up first thing.)		7. Splash face again with cold water till stinging subsides.		*** 8. I then follow with a PH balanced, moisturizing, non-tightening facial mask.  Alba Deep Sea Facial Mask left on for 5-30 minutes (it doesn't really dry out and is VERY moisturizing mud so you can get away with leaving it on for a long time) then gently rinsed off.		9. To still dripping wet face rub in oil.  I am a huge believe in facial oils for daily use.  I use jojoba oil from acne.org, the give you a ton and it lasts forever.  It slowly absorbs into the skin no need to rub too much (is FANTASTIC for oily skin) so no roughing up tender skin and there isn't a long list of ingredients which could potentially interact poorly with the acid that just ate at my face.		**** 10. I use Acne.org Treatment (a really gentle 2.5% benzoyl peroxide cream) every night as well.  I find it helps a lot with keeping my skin clear of acne and new blackheads as well as help keep my make up in place if I put it on the night before and then don't wash my face in the morning.		*** I use step 8 to eliminate dry, flakey skin after a peel, but I have SUPER combination skin that is, at times in the same places, super oily and super dry		**** If acne and blackheads are really your deal, I would still suggest the acne.org Treatment to tighten pores; however, if that also isn't your deal whatever cream or serum deals with you would go great &lt;here>		Sheesh, this is long and I am aware my Process (if reading this out loud make sure to properly emphasize the P) is convoluted and tailored rather specifically to my skins quirks.  However, if you used this product and liked it lots but was then plagued by redness and dry skin consider some variation there in and see if it helps!		I've skipped this product for one two respective occasions and my skin simply did not look as good those weeks.  So this is a skin addiction, not a one time use skin cure forever (what ever is?) which might matter to some people.		Alright, I've run out of things to say.  It might seem like I have a lot of qualifires, but I do believe this product to be worth every penny.  The price and The Process, have nothing on what a Spa would do in terms of both money and time, and the results are on par for me."
B000PLUZL8,2012,11,5.0,24,25,1074,"Miracle in a Bottle","Stats about me:	19 year old Caucasian female.	Struggled with severe acne during puberty and moderate acne these past few years.	Had acne, acne scarring, large pores, oily skin, and two fine lines on my forehead when I bought product.	Has never before written a review on Amazon, but was so satisfied with product that I simply HAD to.		I can't remember how I came across this product on amazon, but once I did, I decided to give it a shot (20 bucks isn't that painful to spend on an experiment). All I can say is WOW. Immediately after using this product, I noticed that my skin looked fresher and clearer. I gasped when I saw it because I wasn't expecting such an immediate change. The next day, the true extent of the effects was seen (I think skin continued sloughing off throughout the night). Many of my pimples had become unclogged and were shrinking, many light acne scars had disappeared completely, the stubborn scars had noticeably faded, and my fine wrinkles became even finer. Talk about fast results!		I've continued using the peel every 5 days (I've used it six times now) and now, my pores don't even have the chance to get clogged and develop pimples. The only zits that I get nowadays are on the edge of my face--either my hairline or along my jaw--because those are the parts of my face that I am not as thorough with when applying the peel. The fine wrinkles on my forehead are virtually undetectable unless if my face gets oily, which only happens if I go without showering for more than 3 days (my skin dries out easily so I space out my showers). The scars aren't even there anymore, and my skin is overall much softer.		My skin has gone from being rather unremarkable--you know, not bad enough to notice, but not good enough to notice either--to beautiful. I now have the type of skin that is clear more often than it is breaking out... something I haven't experienced since I was 12.		I also have scars on my arm from self mutilating when I was young and stupid. I read online that chemical peels are used to professionally remove scars and so I decided to try out my salicylic peel on mine. This was the thing that finally pushed me into writing a review. The results were way above my expectations; all of the fainter scars have faded into being practically nonexistent and the not-so-faint ones have become faint. I cannot wait to see what my arm will look like after I use this peel on it more that once. This is coming from a girl who has bought countless scar-removal creams and has never seen much improvement. At 20 dollars, this peel is half as expensive as mederma and has given me the results in 1 use that 3 tubes of mederma have been unable to. I am so happy because I was always asked about my scars and I was very self-conscious, but now I don't think they are noticeable enough to attract anyone's attention. For all of you who have scars of your own or who know someone who can't get their's to go away, recommend this product PLEASE. It is simply amazing.		I think the reason that so many people on here have had unsatisfying results with this product is because they do not allow the peel to work on their skin long enough. I've kept it on for the maximum 7 minutes every single time I've used it, even the first time, and that's probably why I've had such great results so quickly.		TIPS:	It really burns like hell when you first apply it; but the longer you keep it on, the less it burns. At the end of the 7 minutes, I can't even feel it on my face anymore. So... if you can just get yourself through the first 3 or 4 minutes, you're good to go for the full 7!	I've also found that fanning my face with something heavy-duty, like a plate, takes away the burning sensation and makes it much easier to get through those first few minutes. I don't know how long I could stand to keep it on if I didn't fan my skin.	I go into the shower to rinse it off because I feel like it is safer to stand under a jet of water in order to remove acid from my skin rather than simply splash some onto my face.		After you remove the peel, your skin will get super dry. At first, I just used lotion because that was what was recommended, but when I did so my face stayed dry for days (even when I applied it generously). I had some vitamin E oil in a drawer (a failed scar removal attempt) that I got from walgreens for probably 7 bucks. I rubbed that onto my skin instead and have found that it keeps my skin much better hydrated than lotion. I think the reason for this is because, well, it's pure oil (it feels like olive oil), so its like returning the oil to your face that you had stripped away (but it doesn't look oily after it has been absorbed). Normally, doing this to your skin would result in waking up with a break out, but since your pores are so clean after the peel, I've found that they do not get clogged even when I rub oil into them. The vitamin E oil combined with the effects of the peel also leaves your skin feeling like a baby's butt, which is great.		Make sure that you read the directions of the peel and use a toner beforehand to help open up your pores so the peel can dig deeper. Also, I've noticed that the peel burns A LOT more when your skin is very dry when applying it. Make sure your skin is hydrated before putting on the peel because it hurts much less then.		I know this is a long review, but I just had so much to say about this true miracle in a bottle. I love it so much that I'm even giving bottles away as Christmas presents. I highly recommend that you try it and try all of the tips that I've provided, because I've had amazing results using them and I hope you do as well!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,7,1.0,45,51,155,"Not for my skin","I had such high hopes for this product. In fact, before I purchased it I told everyone I'd found this amazing peel on Amazon but I take that back.		I won't advise anyone to stay away from the product as it obviously worked for many people. I'm african american with a medium complexion. I have combination skin with blocked pores and dark marks all over my face from acne. I used this product for 4 weeks, once every 5 days and the only outcome was incredibly dry/old looking skin even if I used a good moisturizer. All of the marks on my skin are now darker than they were prior to using the product and it did nothing to combat acne. I didn't leave the product on for more than 4 minutes yet the last and final time I did, the skin on my chin burned off leaving bruises.		For me, it wasn't worth it."
B000PLUZL8,2011,9,5.0,27,29,1153,"HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY-Finally relief at 43","I am a 43 year old Caucasian woman and have had acne my whole life.  I would classify my skin as combination sensitive.  My acne has never been bad enough to require Accutane or constant dermatology visits, but it is annoyingly persistent and has worsened into my early 40's.  I usually have small pimples every morning, and larger cysts maybe once a week.  Visible blackheads on my nose that have never resolved.  I have very large pores on my nose and chin and damage from past and ongoing cystic pimples in those areas.  I also have had regular but not so often acne on my cheeks, maybe once a month.  But the acne in those areas discolors my skin for a longer period of time.  I also have 4-5 milia (tiny white hard pimple things that never go away) that have formed around my eyes in the last year or so, probably due to the anti-aging gunk I have started trying there.  Over the years, I have used antibiotics a couple of times and that really seemed to help with the acne.  However, as soon as I stopped, it returned.		I have never had a facial or experienced any kind of chemical peel.  This was my first time.  :)		I have been using this product for about a month, maybe 2x per week.  I always wash my face and then use alcohol all over to clear and prep my skin for the acid.  I do not use a brush or gauze or anything to apply it, but use my fingers.  I pour about 2 pea-sized drops into my left palm and use that to start with.  I apply to my forehead, down my nose, and then to my chin, and then do cheeks and the skin around my nose.  Sometimes I have to pour a bit more into my hand to get it all done.  At the end,  I get a Q-tip and apply it very carefully to the milia closer to my eyes.  Word of warning:  If you are applying close to your eyelashes and they get wet with it, chances are the stuff will slide into your eyes.  And it burns hella bad, requiring super rinse immediately.  Even the fumes off of the stuff will cause your eyes to tear up, so be very very careful if you are working close to your eyes.  THEN WASH YOUR HANDS!  Don't leave the stuff on your hands and fingers.. it will burn.		I left it on for 6 minutes the first time.  It burns all over, yes.  I have been able to leave it on for the full 8 minutes from that point on.  I use a hair dryer on my face, on the cool setting, while I am waiting the 8 minutes.  It still burns, but is tolerable with the air blowing on it.  I then rinse my face with lukewarm to cool water for about 2 or 3 minutes.  A couple of times, my face has stung after rinsing it, but this goes away in about 20 minutes.  I have been using Olay Regenerist micro-sculpting cream after each acid treatment and as a regular moisturizer every day.		At first, I noticed that I did have more small pimples showing up on my nose within about 24 hours of using the acid.  My nose is my worst area, biggest pores, most skin damage due to the past acne.  However, these were small pimples and went away quickly and were not painful like cystic ones.  I have also had two larger pimples try to form on my chin and cheek-but both times, I spot-treated  left it on for 8 minutes, rinsed off) them after washing my face and the cyst virtually collapsed overnight, never progressing to form a pimple.  Amazing.  I can still see the large damaged pores over my nose, but they are flat and do not appear to have the darker appearance of gunk sitting in them (pre-blackhead) as they usually do.  Over the last 2 weeks, my skin has been pretty clear.  I still have some discoloring from past acne, but it covers easily with a light dusting of the Bare Minerals foundation I have been using for years.  I do not have to use any other kind of concealer or spot coverage, which I have in the past.  I do see the discolored areas fading though, especially over the last week.  The milia seem to disappear for a few days immediately after the treatment, then peel a little, then faintly re-appear.  I anticipate that they will eventually peel completely off.  They are much smaller and less-noticeable than they were a month ago.		I love this stuff.  After only a month.  I can't wait to see how my face looks in another month's time.  I have already ordered more, even though I have not even used a quarter of the bottle that I started with.  I also have some of the 35% Glycolic to try at some point, but have been waiting to see how using the Salicylic 20% progressed.  Am very very pleased with this product.  I had lost hope of having pretty skin and was just depending on make-up to cover the acne.  I have used the Biore ice cleanser with a buff puff for years, and it did seem to work at keeping the oil away.  However, the acne persisted.  And I have never been able to use a moisturizer without breaking out-so it is nice to be able to use one now.  The ""peeling"" and ""flaking"" of my skin has not been too bad, either.  I notice it on my cheeks and under my eyes when I have used it there.  Also, the active acne on my nose and chin, when it is drying up, flakes quite a bit.  But all of this is better than the red bumpy scabby normal stuff that I lived with on a day to day basis.		Hopefully, this review will help and someone else who has given up will give this product a try!  I am so glad I did.  :)		Jan 19, 2012 update:  I cycled off of the weekly treatments (alternating Glycolic and Salicylic for 2 mos) for almost 2 months and gave my skin a chance to just relax.  To my relief, the bad acne did not come back.  I still get small pimples on my nose and chin about 2-3 mornings a week.  But none of the cystic stuff that is so painful and scarring.  Just started up the weekly treatments again.  Skin really burned-so it's like starting over.  These products are really amazing.  If nothing else, the salicylic for spot treatments alone is worth it.  As soon as I feel the pain of a pre-zit, I apply this stuff on the spot for a few minutes.  It kills it before it even forms.  Salicylic definitely kills the blackheads too-they just dry up and fall out."
B000PLUZL8,2010,10,5.0,75,88,640,"Give it a week or two and you will be pleasantly surprised","My Problem: I am 28 years old and from south exposed to a lot of UV rays from Sun. The back of my neck, just below the hair, I had signs of aging (wrinkles, big ones) and the whole area was BLACK. I am light brown by complexion. I had a little bit of itching in that area (probably, skin irritation). All of a sudden, one day I noticed that it was black. Then in a couple of days, it got worse, the skin got thicker. I have done a lot of research and found out that the skin was asking me to take care of it since it was black and thickening due to sun damage and improper care.		Ideas: After a lot of research, I bought a sunscreen with SPF of 50. Applied for 3-4 days, no change, the skin was still thick and black. Then, I ordered Palmer's Skin Lightening cream, it seemed like my skin was getting better at one time but would return to black when I looked in the mirror other times. Basically, it did not solve the problem.		My Solution: I do NOT have sensitive skin because I have used almost a lot of stuff on my face in the past but Chemical peel is not something I had ever used. Instead of spending 100s of dollars just to get the diagnosis, I thought I would give this a shot. If I do not see a difference, I might be visiting a dermatologist anyway. Ordered from Amazon, came on time. Applied once, no change. Applied twice, no change. Applied thrice, no change but skin thickening seemed to be becoming normal. Applied the fourth time, I saw the WHITE FROSTING on my skin, Viola. In the next two days, my skin is medium brown and the thickening that shows the sign of aging is TOTALLY GONE. I am going to stick with this therapy for few more days till my skin becomes in tone with my neck.		Procedure: If you are going to try this, PLEASE HAVE PATIENCE. THERE IS NO MIRACLE DRUG OUT THERE. PLEASE TEST IT ON YOUR ARMS BEFORE YOU USE THIS ON ANY PART OF YOUR BODY TO SEE IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ANY CONTENTS.	DO NOT SHAVE OR EXFOLIATE THE AREA 24 HOURS BEFORE OR AFTER APPLYING THIS ACID.	DAY 1: Clean you area where you are going to apply this using an unscented body wash. Gently clean off the water using a cotton cloth (DO NOT RUB). Use a Gauze pad or cotton ball to apply this onto your skin. Use only one coating, don't apply over and over on the same area. Wait for 2 minutes. Wash if off with cold water (DO NOT RUB). Clean with a cotton cloth (DO NOT RUB). Apply a moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 or higher.	DAY 3: Repeat the same process but leave it on for 4 minutes.	DAY 5: Repeat the same process but leave it on for 8 minutes.	DAY 7 and On: Repeat the same process and leave it on for 8 minutes.		DIFFERENCE: Some people might see the frosting right at the first time while others like me will see in few applications, that is because it is doing its job from top to bottom. So be patient. I am not a nurse, but frosting is what seems to clear up the skin, so if it does not frost, chances are you are not getting rid of your problems. You just need patience till it does.		RATING: I give it a 5 star because this has saved me ton of money. I am going to order few more for my friends too. If you need more education, research on youtube for a channel called ""DermTV"". This doctor gives great tips on skin.		THANKS FOR READING."
B000PLUZL8,2009,2,5.0,20,21,213,"so far, so good","I have been using this product for about a month now and I must say I have seen positive changes! I still have persistent acne on my right cheek but once I apply the peel it starts to dissapear fast. This product has shown positive signs clearing the dark spots on my face too. I have spent so much money on many products including proactive but this works far much better! I hope I continue to see positive results so I can have a spotless and healthy skin once again. I would reccommend this product no doubt. Also, I have dark skin and I sometimes use it more often than advised(don't do it because I do). Goodluck!		March 25th- Still have acne but they have decreased in severity. I Still have dark spots but since using this peel, they have continue to lighten. I am still breaking out and changes right now seems slow so I'm thinking of buying Lactic acid peel. I'll give y'all an update later. I would still recommend this product, I just thought by now, I'd have a flawless face.		May 10th- This product didn't work for me in the long term. I'm going to try the Lactic acid and use this as a pre-peel. Argh! the search continues..."
B000PLUZL8,2008,6,5.0,217,267,126,"VERY pleased","I started having problems with adult onset acne at about age 25 - am now 40.  Have tried everything - oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics, retin-a, etc. etc.  Despite trying numerous dermatologists, I never got what I considered good results - just a three minute visit and a couple of scripts.  Decided to try this - at the price, nothing to lose.  Man am I pleased.  For the first time, acne is resolved (I have used the peel once a week for about six weeks).  My scarring is improved and my skin tone is becoming much more even.  Even improving my melasma.  I would highly recommend this product.  Word of caution.  Acne will worsen after the first treatment - wait it out - it will improve Dramatically."
B000PLUZL8,2010,9,5.0,79,96,741,"I got my nose back!","Well, I suppose my title got your attention. What does that mean? Let me start at the beginning and walk you through this. I developed Rosacea as an adult, about 40 or so, I'm 58/male. At first it was just some redness that was no big deal. Well one of the side effects is that Rhinophyma can start to develop. That's what happened to me. It starts slowly, you don't even realize it is happening. If you have ""normal"" bathroom lighting it actually masks a lot of the first stages. I went to Vegas for a wedding and the bathroom at the hotel had fluorescent lighting. If you want to see something frighting, go look in a mirror and use fluorescent lights. Holy COW! The skin on my nose looked gray! I also had one place on my nose that was a stubborn pimple. It wasn't red though so I never paid it a lot of attention. I like to think that I'm not narcissistic, but my nose got to the point that it was starting to call attention to itself. There would be times that I got pimples also, make no mistake about that! I tried OTC acne products,not much difference, heck I tried so many things I can't list them all. Sure I'd get some peeling but nothing really changed. So, I ordered this and Glycolic Acid and got them the first of August. I wanted to use it for 2 months before I reported back. So here I am. I have not used the Glycolic Acid yet, I've used 1/2 bottle of the Salicylic.		O.k. here is what I did. I have used it almost exclusively on the nose, along with a couple other problem areas. First the results on the nose. Like the title says - I have my nose back! It is a normal looking nose as smooth as you would expect for someone my age if not smoother. The excess gray (dead) skin is 95-99% gone at this point. It is flesh-colored and has no bumps anymore. I figured the bump was a cyst of some time, deep in the nose. It took a lot of work to get it out, even with this product. When I had finally removed enough layers of dead skin then an amazing amount of fluid came out. I hope I haven't grossed you out too much but if there is anyone out there that has gone through this they understand the frustration. BTW I've been to dermatologists in the past, ALL of them told me that it would cost thousands of dollars to apparently do what I've done for under $20.		Here is exactly what I did. I used this product every day, sometimes twice a day for two months. Did it sting? No,not for a LONG time. There was so much dead skin that it didn't make a dent. Does it sting NOW? Yes, but nothing that I can't handle. Mild stinging. I used a cotton swab(Q-tip type) to apply it. I waited the ten minutes then used COLD water to remove it. Patted it dry with a towel and then used jojoba oil immediately after. I highly recommend the jojoba oil in conjunction with this. I produce a lot of Sebum btw (probably had a Sebum cyst.) You can get the jojoba oil right here on Amazon too. It seems to balance all kinds of skin types.		You will get some peeling but I saw a lot less peeling on areas of my face besides my nose. The other areas I mentioned are another problem area that also had an old acne scar that looked like a small punch hole. This area improved so much that one day I went to apply the Salicylic and I was unsure where the area was. THAT was very gratifying. You DO have to keep using it though. Based on my results you can't just stop using it. I have gotten to the point where I use it a couple times a week now. I think that I will switch to the Glycolic Acid next since it's a longer interval on that regime. The Salicylic instructions say that you can use it every day. I'm also going to use a bit over the rest of my face because it DOES smooth out the flesh very nicely.		At any rate, that's what I did and that's what I got. My nose back!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,9,3.0,1,4,188,"superficial benefits","The bottle arrived promptly in one layer of bubble wrap and a box; I was concerned about the glass bottle breaking but it arrived intact. The peel itself made my skin smoother and diminished the size of my pores; I saw these results immediately, and received several compliments on how smooth my face looked. It burned and tingled with the first use, but I quickly developed a tolerance, so that I could leave it on way over 20 minutes. My skin peeled with the first use only.	While I would recommend this to someone who wants smoother skin, I would not recommend it for clearing acne, as it seemed to aggravate my spots rather than soothe and exfoliate them.	I also have been using it persistently on a wart on my finger. The wart is the same size, just smoother on the surface...	It's also probably worth mentioning that the only peeling I experienced was on my chin, which was COVERED in super-inflamed pimples. The peeling that occurred around 4 days later made it impossible to wear make-up; foundation on-top of flaking skin is not a good look."
B000PLUZL8,2010,2,2.0,4,10,67,"Not impressed...","I've been using this product for 5-weeks.  Honestly, my skin looks the same.  The only time I had any peeling was when I got a little peel happy and applied Alpha Hydroxy on off days.  YES!  I know.  Not everyone will experience peeling all the time, and not that I really wanted that.  I just wanted...something.  Granted, I only spent $18.95.  I should have known better.  Bah."

B000PLUZL8,2012,2,1.0,1,6,172,"Not helpful for female premenstrual breakouts","I tried using this because i was getting adult acne on my chin (large recurring zits right before my monthly cycle). All this product has done is severely dry out my skin rather than prevent or treat acne. If you're looking for a way to get rid of premenstrual zits, What i've found to be more effective is to ice the zit immediately when you start to feel it forming under the surface. In addition to icing it, i also push the zit down while icing it, repeating that 3 times daily, but you have to start doing that before the zit has time to get bigger. I also put benzoyl peroxide spot cream on it. I've also noticed an improvement and less breakouts since i've been exercising 30 min a day several days a week, drinking more water and adding more raw fruits and vegetables to my diet, also taking low doses of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) supplements which is supposed to help balance hormones during that time of the month."

B000PLUZL8,2011,7,1.0,3,10,37,"What a waste...","This stuff did not get rid of my acne or improve my scars. In fact, it exacerbated both! What a total rip off. For professional results, I think that you just need to go to the professionals."

B000PLUZL8,2010,9,1.0,5,16,247,"Causes more pimples than you already have","Well I'm 18 years old and I barely get pimples. My face is almost completely clear most of the time, but recently I've been getting some pimples hear and there..nothing big though. So I used this product to get rid of the pimples and I've only been applying it to the pimple areas and not my entire face since its already clear... So far I've never had any peeling around the pimple area and I've been using large amounts for up to 7 minutes and this is my third time using it. Basically what happens is that the pimples became much smaller and turn redish when the acid is applied. After water is applied it turns extremely white. Is this suppose to happen? Afterwards when I dry the water out, the pimples become darkish. So basically this product turns the big pimples into dark more scattered pimples that look worse than starting. Maybe I shouldn't be using this. Also I wanted to know if I could use this for my back?		Update: 3 weeks after product. This literally has done more damage than harm to my face. I honestly had only one or two pimples that were getting irritating and forced me to use this product. It has literally made pimples grow all around the area that I've used it and they pimple still haven't gone. I would not recommend for people who are young or minor pimples. I'm really hoping the pimples will be gone soon..."

B000PLUZL8,2010,11,4.0,9,10,352,"Painful...but definitely worth it","I'm 34 years old and I have really sensitive, semi-dry skin.  I have some hyperpigmentation from sun damage and monthly blemishes.  I have maybe had 2 facials in my life so my skin was not used to such a high concentration of salicylic acid, or any other kind of acid for that matter.  I have used the product about 4 times now.  The first time I used it I literally felt like the skin was burning off my face.  After the fourth use it's at the point where it still burns but it's not unbearable and I can last the whole 10 minutes.		Although the peel is painful it has definitely been worth it.  I was afraid I would have a lot of dry skin on my face which would show through my makeup since I have semi-dry skin already but it honestly wasn't that bad.  There were probably 3 small dry patches but you couldn't see them through my makeup and after the second day I used a dry washcloth and wiped the dry skin off.  My skin is very smooth now and the hyperpigmentation is almost gone.  Before I would never go out in public without makeup on because I felt like people could see my age in the condition of my skin but now I have no problem going out with a clean face.  I have used a number of products of all price ranges in the past to minimize the hyperpigmentation and nothing ever worked.  This is the first product I have ever used with success.		If you can't stand the pain and can only tolerate a minute or two the first couple times you use this product you will still see outstanding results.  Also, it says to use lotion after using the peel but I have been putting on toner and that has really been a more effective way of moisturizing my skin immediately after using the peel.		I gave this product 4 starts out of 5 due to the pain.  As far as effectiveness is concerned it deserves 5 stars but the stinging is really unpleasant."
B000PLUZL8,2012,7,5.0,6,6,323,"Simply works","Background:  I have what the doctors call ""problem"" skin.  I have active acne, acne scars, sun damage, and the beginning of some not-so-fine lines.  In short, I have a hate-hate relationship with my skin.  Like many people, I have truly tried every product out there.  Prescription, over the counter, every acid you can think of.  This is one of the best ""over the counter"" product I have ever used.		Now, keep in mind it is not a miracle worker.  Salicylic acid has been used for years to ""exfoliate"" the skin, that is, to increase cell turnover.  The great thing about this product is its potency, but that also means it will sting like the dickens.		I have also seen a lot of misinformation out there about how often this can be used.  The truth is, you can use this every day (the company itself will tell you this).  It is not actually a peel.  Your skin may peel a little bit after the first couple of times using it, but for the most part there will not be visible peeling (unless you have incredibly sensitive skin and/or have never used an exfoliant. Like, ever).		Additionally, I am one of the people who don't wash this product off.  It will absolutely self-neutralize after anywhere from 5-10 minutes.		Finally, I hate when people tell you that some skin product is a miracle worker after just one use.  Nothing will change your skin after one use.  But when used consistently, this is a great product to increase cellular turnover, which will keep your pores more clear and will reduce inflammation.  This means that you are likely to see lesser breakouts after extended use.  And, salicylic is the only acid that can be used, rather is encouraged to be used prior to other, stronger peels.  Considering how expensive most products are with salicylic acid, I think this is a great deal and can totally work for you."
B000PLUZL8,2012,7,5.0,6,6,345,"Excellent product","This is one of the best products I have ever purchased. I am over 40 and have been out in the sun a lot through the years. I've been trying different products to try to counter the effects of aging. I have spent a lot of money and, ironically, this product (which is by far the least expensive) has done the most to improve my skin's appearance.		I was hesistant to purchase this but it got such good reviews that I decided to give it a try. I know that some of the reviewers let it burn their face and then let it heal which almost made me not purchase the item. First, I have sensitive skin so I was worried about what it would do to me. Also, I work every day and cannot be in hiding for a few days while my face heals. However, when I got the bottle and read the instructions, they specifically say to not leave it on until your face burns. It recommends starting out with leaving it on for one minute and then only doing it once per week, increasing your time up to eight minutes. I did that and increased by one minute per week. I did learn to only wash my face by hand before I apply the peel; when I use a Clarisonic first, it makes my face too sensitive and I start to burn.		When I first started using this, my acne (which didn't even develop until I turned 35) got worse but now I have not had a blemish in months. The real improvements this peel provides don't show immediately but come after using the product consistently for a few weeks. I have had many people ask what I am doing and I tell everyone about this. It has really improved my skin. I am now ready to increase to the 30% solution.		I really do recommend reading and adhering to the instructions that come with the bottle. I think that is the safest and most effective way to use this product."
B000PLUZL8,2012,5,5.0,6,6,251,"I've tried it all","And this is it!!  The end of the quest to rid myself of acne!!		For years, I suffered from adult onset acne.  Huge, cystic pimples that I would try to pop and nothing would come out.  I had scarred my face and still the pimples kept coming.  Then I got a Mirena IUD, and that makes your acne WORSE!!!		I tried antibacterial soap, more moisturizer, less moisturizer, sulphur soap, no soap, every facewash on the shelf. I was starting to get so depressed and embarrassed of my acne.  I was going through concealer at a rapid rate.  On top of the acne, my skin was red around my nose and my mouth.  I had horribly uneven skin tone to boot!!		I finally bit the bullet and tried this.  The first 2 applications, I didn't see much of a result, but by the third, WOW WOW WOW.  People at work started to notice, my sister saw a picture and was amazed.  I can't stop looking at my face!		I only use this once a week and I also started using Jojoba oil as a moisturizer, which you would think is a bad idea for acne prone skin, but it's another miracle worker.		I know you're probably nervous you'll damage your face.  It's easy and you just start off slow.  I'll even use this as a spot treatment.  I had a pimple on my neck the other day and I just dabbed a bit on and in an hour, the pimple was gone!!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,3,5.0,6,6,739,"If I could give it 10 stars I would!!!","I have been looking for some kind of miracle to clear up old acne scars on my back and to even out skin tone, reduce pores on my tzone, and clear up a few acne marks on my face and I have FINALLY found it!!!!!!!		I bought this stuff with a little bit of trepidation, but after reading many reviews and deciding to give it a go as my last resort before heading to the dermatologist I couldn't be any happier! I decided not to buy the toner or witch hazel, seemed like a waste of money when it clearly states that you can just use water to neutralize the peel and rubbing alcohol to clean the area prior to the peel. I did however splurge and buy 100% natural Argan oil as a recommendation from another reviewer, and since Argan oil has so many more added benefits for your skin I decided why not take something good and make it better? and yet again it was a good choice!		this is the argan oil I purchased,		http://www.amazon.com/Slice-Nature%C2%A9-Virgin-Argan-pressed/dp/B001PEZAHI/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1335537002&sr=1-1		The other reviewer had given a link to a different brand which was quite a bit more pricier and I so I looked around for something a little easier on the pocketbook and still natural oil with high reviews.		I did the peel for the first time last night. I started by wiping down the area with rubbing alcohol, then I used an old clean concealer brush (you can also go to your local craft store and buy a cheap art brush in a size 10 or so or a fan brush.) Then I added the peel to the areas I wanted to correct (Note I did not put it on my entire face) I added it to my T-zone, chin, nose, part of my forehead and part of my cheeks. I then also added the peel to sections on my back that had acne scars and healing acne spots. It was much more tolerable on my back and not too uncomfortable, I left that on for about 6-8 minutes. My face was much more sensitive and I started with a slight itchy tingly feel and progressed to a moderate burn. I tolerated that for about 3-5 minutes. I then used cool water and nothing else and scrubbed my face using only my hands and within 30 seconds I found relief from the burn.		After the peel I added the argan oil all over my face and back and rubbed it in real well. My skin felt extremely soft and relaxed after this. This morning the redness from recent acne is almost gone, the acne scars has been slightly minimized, my pores have shrunk drastically, I have no more bumps or uneven skin, the skin tone has evened out, and my skin is baby soft. I feel beautiful :-))) I went to work this morning with minimal make-up and it feels absolutely wonderful, I touch my face in amazement. I feel like a peeled off several years of skin!		HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! (with the use of argan oil)		(I also added a picture from this morning, the day after of the peel. I did not take a before picture and I regret doing so now, but understand when I took pictures of my face I would ALWAYS photo edit out the blemishes and soften the focus to even my skin tone so I wouldn't look like a walking dead person before anyone would ever view the picture. I'm the girl with the long brown hair and bangs)		*UPDATE* I DID go to the dermatologist to help prevent new acne, which I learned I have cystic acne, plus OCD on picking at it. I started taking Minocylcine and that has improved my skin dramatically, along with still using this product as well as tea tree oil I had my acne down to just minimal dark spots. The bumps and larger nastier looking stuff was about gone. I was hoping to soon see a decrease in dark spots, however I became pregnant and had to discontinue my entire regime. Months later the horror of bad back acne started to resurface and began creating new scars, so I don't know what the progress could have potentially been. Once the baby is born and I can continue back on the medication and gel I will restart and see what happens from there."
B000PLUZL8,2011,8,2.0,6,6,129,"Didn't work for me!","After reading all kinds of glowing reviews for this product, I was eager to try it!  I followed the instructions carefully, using it about once a week and starting with just one minute of time on my skin, and gradually working my way up to about 7 minutes.		I have some minor acne, and a problem with clogged pores, but unfortunately this product did not seem to clear my skin at all, even after several months of use.		PROS:  Very clear instructions, cheap enough that even though it didn't work for me, I don't feel like I got ripped off!		CONS: BURNS when you rinse it off, causes some redness, and DIDN'T clear my acne.		Bottom line - it didn't work for me, but it was worth a try!"
B000PLUZL8,2011,3,5.0,6,6,222,"Helps with Hypertrophic Scars and Acne Scars","This stuff works fast. I wish I had tried this a long time ago. I am African American and I have been struggling with a hypertrophic on my face for a couple years. After doing massive research, I decide to use a derma-roller, super cop 2x, and salicylic acid peels on the scar. I started out with a 5% salicylic acid cream, then I moved up to this 20% peel. Every few day, a layer would peel off, and the scar is almost totally flat now. Using the copper along with it (peel in the morning, copper 2x at night), the scar has become much more like the normal surrounding skin. I decided to leave this review for anyone out there who is struggling with a hypertrophic scar and doesn't know what to do. I searched for the last two years and nobody had a real answer for what African Americans can do for this type of scar beside laser treatment, which is very expensive. 2-3 months of derma roller plus copper at night, and a gentle peel every other morning, can literally remodel the scar and allow you to rebuild more normal, healthy skin in place of it. Copper is crucial because it helps prevent the skin from re-forming the type of abnormal scar tissue that is typical in hypertrophic scars."
B000PLUZL8,2010,11,4.0,6,6,292,"Seeing some results","I decided to try this salicylic acid gel peel because although I mostly have scarring from old pimples all over my forehead, I also have occasional breakouts of two or three in random places on my face. This stuff seems to be working, and I've only been using it for a little under 2 weeks. My old scars are lighter, and the pimples that occasionally pop up dry out pretty quickly. Also, my skin doesn't feel super tight or dry after I use it as long as I apply a moisturizer. With Murad, no matter how much moisturizer I used, I still felt ""creaky."" My only complaints are the peeling skin and the sting factor when applied (although based on other reviews, these were expected).		Also, please note that as other reviewers have said, you will SEEM to break out more when using this for the first few times. But it is simply ""under-the-skin"" pimples coming to the surface. For over three months I have had a small patch of bumps on the left side of my face that were definitely pimples but never came to a head. After using this peel 3 times (once every other day), I suddenly have white heads on that side! Sounds gross, but NOW they'll dry up, pop, and go away, rather than sitting under my skin like glorified goosebumps. :D I couldn't be happier.		Tips for this product:	1. Test out how often to use this for yourself (I use it every other day unless my skin gets too peely)	2. Moisturize! Moisturize! Moisturize! It would be good to get a face moisturizer with aloe, because it may irritate your skin at first.	3. Have patience. It may look bad at first, but keep going!"
B000PLUZL8,2010,6,5.0,6,6,384,"The Adult Acne Miracle Cure","I have never been so pleased with a product in my life. I feel like I've finally found the secret to amazing skin (sorry for sounding like an infomercial). I am 25 years old and in the past year or so after never really having severe acne all my life, I developed severe cystic adult acne. No matter what I did it would not go away. I can't tell you how many thousands of dollars I've spent on beauty products at your usual beauty store claiming to get rid of adult acne. Tried various medications, everything. THIS STUFF IS ONLY $18 and it's been AMAZING. To get my skin used to it initially (be warned, I don't really know the correct usage of this stuff but this is how I did it), I applied it every three days starting at a minute and increasing by one minute every three days it was applied, working my way up to eight minutes. I noticed very minimal peeling, but my skin improved drastically, even not being at the eight minute mark. Two days ago, I finally made it up to eight minutes, and my skin is peeling significantly today! Not enough where someone could really notice, unless they stood directly in front of me. I am excited because I see amazing new skin emerging underneath, and at this point since I only have acne scars left, I am hoping to see them fade over time. I will continue to do eight minute peels once a week and see what happens. As far as the burning goes, it wasn't as bad as I had expected based on the other reviews I'd read here. It feels more hot than anything else. I actually find putting my face in front of a fan more irritating than without. But maybe I'm just the exception. I will warn you though.. if you get cold sores, do not apply this stuff on the areas you've gotten cold sores.. you WILL get new ones if you do. I learned the hard way. But I've since avoided the area and I seem to be doing fine so far!		I've never reviewed anything on Amazon before, but this stuff was just too good not to say something about it. BUY THIS! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"

I am taking Minocycline and just started so hopefully this peel will help with the red marks left behind.	As far as the peel on your face, yes it does sting but its managable!  I leave it on for 2 mins max. then add cold water for a mintue.  I have a combo skin type but more on the dry side so I do experience flaking of the skin.  Use an spf most definitley!	Overall: I would say to give it a try and see for yourself since its much more cost efficient then going to spas as I have in the past!It does make ur skin feel nice and smooth but the peeling part sucks.  Hope I can see some results soon!"
B000PLUZL8,2010,8,4.0,6,7,255,"It's made a difference","I am African American with very oil skin and hyperpigmentation left from using Proactive serveral years ago. My scars are primarily on my cheeks & a few on my forehead. After meeting with an esthetician who suggested I spend $980 on Obagi & an additional $500 on chemical peels, I thought I'd try this peel first. I also purchased the Glycolic peel which I've only used a few times and Kiss My Face Pore Shrink which I've tried and love. I no longer have reoccuring breakouts on my cheeks & forehead. My skin tone has improved significantly. Previously I had raised bumps (that hurt when inflamed) on both my cheeks. These bumps would go from inflamed to non-inflamed, but pretty much never healed or went away; they are gone. I apply a baking soda/water mixture to my face to deactivate the acid. I cleanse with African Black Soap & add a few drops of Jojoba Oil to my face while cleansing w/the black soap. Jojoba oil is a great moisturizer that actually penatrates my skin. After researching I learned my skin is oily b/c it is over compensating for dryness. The Jojoba Oil has balanced my nautral sebum (oil) production. In adddition to topical changes, I've completed a 5 day liquid only cleanse, twice in the last year. I've implemented Zinc Supplements & Flaxseed (fresh ground or oil I go back & forth) which is really good for your skin as well. These things have worked wonders for me. I am pleased with the product."
B000PLUZL8,2009,5,5.0,8,10,179,"Amazing Results","This product is absolutely amazing! I have mild-moderate acne. I always tend to break out in phases. And I hate those dark spots/scars that appear after my acne has disappeared! Usually it takes many weeks/months for those marks to fade!! I have tried numerous products that are supposed to fade those marks (such as Acne Free fade gel, Neutrogena, even prescription cream), but none have worked as well as this Salicylic acid gel peel!!! I received this item about a week ago, and my marks are almost completely gone. Some of the reviews state it takes a while, and I think it totally depends on the severity of acne and scars. I do not think this will get rid of major scars that cause indentations on the skin, but it definitely works to fade those dark marks. I leave it one for about 5-10 minutes morning and night, and follow up with a thick moisturizer/night cream--since it makes me dry out a bit. I am almost at the point where I don't need concealer anymore! Definitely worth the buy!"
B000PLUZL8,2013,0,5.0,3,3,310,"Lives up to the hype!","I am a 21 year old female (using my boyfriends's Amazon account, of course) with stress-induced acne and plugged pores on the nose and chin, as well as unevenness under nostrils and acne scarring on either side of my chin. I just got done using this peel, following top commenter Elane's steps 1 - 8. I very highly recommend using her steps for the use of this product, as it will greatly help with the pain.		Before anything, I washed my face with a bar of witch hazel soap in the shower, then I poured a pot of boiling water into my bathroom sink and steamed my face for five minutes. I then applied a lavender witch hazel toner generously and waited for that to dry. Once the toner had absorbed, I took a cotton ball and quickly applied the salicylic acid (don't get too close to the sensitive areas underneath your eyes!) and was able to leave it on for the maximum time of 8 minutes by sticking my head in the freezer...I wish I were kidding. This stuff is intense. Do be sure to rinse with cold water for a minute and then use a baking soda/water paste to VERY GENTLY wash your face.		If it weren't for the freezer and baking soda cheats, I'm not sure how I would have gotten through this treatment. Had I not resorted to sticking my head in the freezer, I would have only lasted about a minute. As I'm typing this comment, I have on a raw honey/coconut oil mask (1/2 teaspoon of each) which I plan to leave on for 30 minutes. After rinsing off, I plan to apply a mix of my usual moisturizers which include lavender oil, argan oil, and olive oil (one drop of each). I will continue using this treatment, and highly recommend it so far."
B000PLUZL8,2012,9,3.0,3,3,268,"DON'T USE FOR TOO LONG!","1st day: I dabbed some on my cheeks and nose with a cotton swab, left it on for about 4 minutes. IT BURNED A LOT. I felt like Bane when Batman tried pulling his mask off (I'm exagggerating, it wasn't that bad, but it wasn't a fun 4 minutes). After submerging my face in water, I noticed some white frosting (not the donut kind, the dead skin kind, unless you're into dead skin-iced donuts, in which case, eww) on my cheeks.		2nd day: Wanting results fast (and wanting the frosting to go away), I dabbed some on my face again, left it on for about 8 minutes. I would compare the pain to the feeling you get when your older brother gets a better toy in his happy meal... seriously, it stings for all 8 minutes. After liberally applying water, I noticed my skin was a lot darker/redder.		3rd day: Peeling. So much peeling. If I were an orange, I'd be naked. So much dead skin came off my face. As the skin peeled off, my face was very soft and sensitive.		At this point, do NOT put more on, wait a few days... or maybe even a week. You should NOT use this every day, your face needs time to recover. Also, do NOT put it on for more than 4 minutes or so, you WILL get dark patches of skin.		TL;DR- if you use it more than once every 3-4 days, you will get dark patches on skin. don't use it before any social events. use it sparingly, and moderately, and you will get good results."
B000PLUZL8,2012,8,5.0,3,3,531,"satisfied - using for rosacea and sun spots","I've been using this for about 6 months and find it to be ok on melasma and sun spots, but surprisingly good on my rosacea.  I was diagnosed with rosacea 8 years ago and used Finacea for several years.  I developed melasma about 5 years ago and tried TriLuma cream for a year or so, but it never did much for me.  I stopped going to the dermatologist a few years ago and have been trying to treat my skin problems on my own.  I bought this product hoping that it would help fade my sun spots and melasma, which is mainly on my forehead and under my eyes.  I used to have rosacea outbreaks at least a few times a week, which consisted mainly of redness and flushing.  I had persistent redness and splotchiness on my cheeks and one red spot from rosacea on my nose that the dermatologist told me was permanent.		The first few times I used this peel I was only able to tolerate it for a minute total.  I'd start on my forehead and do my cheeks last.  It burned so badly that my eyes teared up, and after I washed my face, my skin was left very flushed.  But by the next day my skin was back to normal.  I used this once a week for a few weeks and noticed that my rosacea outbreaks stopped completely.  Even using Finacea twice a day I'd have flare ups occasionally, was very surprised that it stopped entirely with this peel.		I used this peel once a week for about six weeks, then cut back and only applied it every few weeks.  I started getting rosacea flare ups a month ago and realized that I hadn't used this peel for several weeks, so I started up again and the flare ups stopped.  I put it on my forehead first, then wait 2-3 minutes to apply to the rest of my face.  I can tolerate it for 2-3 minutes now on my cheeks, and have no redness afterward.  It has faded the darkness on my forehead and the splotchiness on my cheeks, but very slowly.  I didn't notice any fading at all until very recently.  I look in the mirror now and often don't see any of my horrible rosacea splotchiness at all.  Maybe a more aggressive dermatologist would have done some sort of treatments to fade my redness, but my doctor was very nonchalant about my skin, told me that I was basically stuck with the redness.  I used a green tinted powder to tone down the redness, but thought that I was going to have to live with it the rest of my life.  This peel has done more for my rosacea than Finacea, TriLuma cream and all those trips to the dermatologist.  My bottle is almost empty and I will definitely buy more.		My skin is very sensitive to sunscreen, and it's important to apply sunscreen after using this peel.  Neutragena and Aveeno can burn my skin, so I normally use Vanicream sunscreen after this peel.  It can be heavy otherwise, but my skin is dry after the peel and the Vanicream works well for me."
B000PLUZL8,2012,8,5.0,3,3,168,"The best acne control","I am a 44 year old mom and grandmother who still had to deal with acne...It WAS terrible. I have tried various regimens that worked to some degree but never always or consistently until now. I love using the Salicylic Acid Gel Peel. I use it once a week followed the next day by either a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001THWULA"">Glycolic Acid 50% Gel Peel, 100ml</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PNXBU8"">Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)</a>. After doing this for three weeks I began to notice that I was not breaking out anymore, AT ALL! I have continued to use this regimen with magnificent results with no acne, much fewer and smaller blackheads, and my skin tone is so smooth and even. I have given up on foundation all together because I love the way my skin looks. I use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NBJAWI"">Physicians Formula Tinted Moisturizer SPF-15, Fair to Light 1122 1 fl oz (30 ml)</a> and a translucent face powder and I get compliments on my skin which use to never happen."
B000PLUZL8,2012,6,1.0,3,3,116,"Not for the faint-hearted","I've never really thought of myself as having sensitive skin, but this peel HURT. The burning was tough to handle, so I would only leave it on for about 2 minutes each time. (The directions say to start off with 1 minute at a time so it's not like I put on an inadequate amount.)	 I used this product for 5 weeks, once a week, and didn't see much of a difference in my skin. Perhaps the people giving this 5 stars are putting it on more frequently and for longer, but they have extraordinary tolerance (or fried facial nerves.)  I have now stopped using the peel, and there hasn't been any change. What a flop."
B000PLUZL8,2012,5,5.0,3,3,391,"Slow and steady improvement","Anyone who has acne should give this a shot. It sounds kinda scary but isn't. My skin was a complete wreck because I tried out the Oil Cleansing Method. I won't go into details because you can find out more about it on other sites. I expected some purging but it seemed to bring out 30 years worth of gunk onto my face. Every single pore was clogged and I had huge pimples and marks galore. I even persisted with the cleansing hoping it would clear up but no such luck. I was just one of the unlucky few who couldn't get it to work.	So in desperation I bought the salicylic acid. I followed the instructions closely, 1 minute for the first time and gradually increasing until 8 minutes every application. I used it every five days. It stings every single time! It feels as if there are a 100 ants biting the face. I also used a fan to blow my face because other reviewers suggested it and it does seem to help. After the time is up, I wash my face with water and use some baking soda.	After 12 applications, while I still have some scattered spots, the improvement is amazing, considering how bad my skin was. Most of the clogging is gone, I don't feel the little bumps under my skin any more and my skin is much smoother. A lot of the marks have faded as well. So I have hope that my skin will continue improving.	The side effects were manageable. I've used Renova in the past and this acid doesn't give me the same sensitive feeling I have on the skin. When I apply other things on my face such as sunblock, my skin doesn't sting compared to using the retinoid. There's usually some mild scabbing and peeling on the third day of using the acid, but the skin comes off cleanly. When using Renova or other retinoids, my skin would have dry, flaking patches which were more unsightly. At the beginning, it was a bit alarming because I had dark brown patches but after the ""burnt"" bits came off, the skin underneath was smooth.	Aftercare is also important, every day I put sunblock and after using the acid I put some oil, usually argan or tamanu.	I'm glad I tried this out."
B000PLUZL8,2012,4,2.0,3,3,175,"Be Careful with this","I used this product exactly as instructed when it came. I used for about a month with applications every 4 days. I Liked the effects from the initial couple of peels. Then like others I broke out with painful cystic acne after the 3rd peel. I wanted to muscle through this period reading that this will clear up eventually and I would have pushed through this period, however, I ended up having a disturbing side effect from this peel. Now, not only do I have acne scars, acne and clogged poors on the left side of my face (this is my only problem area for some reason) I now have a white spot of discoloration. I beleive this occured b/c I went into the sun a few days after a peel for only about 10 mins without sun block. I felt it wasn't worth the side effects to continue. I'm not sure when this discoloration will get back to normal, but it's been 2 months and I think it will be here to stay :("

I have been using the OTC spot remover with some success but it takes continuous use of 30 or more days.  I've only used this item once so the jury is still out.  However, at the first try, I felt a burning sensation right after application.  I'd suggest following the guidelines as suggested in the directions:  not leave on for more than 8 minutes although I think that would be much too long a time.  I removed it within 1 minute of application which required lots of rinsing off with water and followed with a soothing face cream."

Use a good moisturizer afterwards.I know that sounds crazy, especially when you've been use to keeping your skin free of anything like that. I use neutrogena wrinkle repair, it is not greasy and leaves just the right amount of moisturizer without leaving my oily skin feeling greasy.

It definitely takes a few times to build up a tolerance to this product.  The first time I tried it I put it all over my face, and the sides of my nose were raw and peeling really bad by the next day.  The next time I just did it on the spots where the acne scars were and that seemed to work a lot better for me.  After a couple of days I was looking in the mirror and one of the scars literally disappeared in front of me. I saw a dry piece of skin ready to fall off and it peeled right off along with the scar.  That was enough for me to keep using this product.  It does dry your face out, but that's the whole point. I have gone through a ton of moisturizer while using this product but it's totally worth it. Probably not for everyone, but it worked for me and I'm very happy.  I also purchased the skin PH balancer which feels awesome after rinsing off the peel. I'm Hispanic and have medium to dark skin so I tend to get really dark scars, especially around my mouth, chin, and jaw line. This really minimized that.  Sunscreen also does wonders.

Where my dermatologist had done her work the skin is completely white and makes my dark spots look worse.  Basically my chest looked like I had been in an awful fire.  A plastic surgeon gave me laser treatments which worked but each treatment cost $300 and would lighten an area about the size of the dime.  At that rate I would be spending $30,000 on my chest!  I have been using the Salicylic Acid for about 6 weeks now.  I clean my chest with alcohol first and then dab it all over my chest. I leave it on for about 10 minutes and then rinse it off with cold water. My chest is still not perfect by it certainly has made a huge difference.

It's a little sensitive on my cheecks and definitely near my eyes.		My question is, for the first time yesterday, I applied this under my eyes with a Q-tip on my fine lines and had to remove it immediately (about or less than a minute). My skin under my eyes were slightly pink and my fine lines now look like wrinkles!!		My questions are:		Will this go away? my fine lines are prominent	and when I use this prduct, should I continue using it under my eyes or no?

I use this in conjuntion with other homeopathic products because I tried everything under the sun and nothing has worked.  I also take zinc and pantothenic acid pills 2x a day.  Because of the peeling, I also use hyaluronic acid with my moisturizer and sunblock.  Seems to be working like a charm.  Sounds like a lot of stuff, but its still cheaper than paying to see a dermatologist who writes out expensive prescriptions that do not work.

But I got a really bad breakout due to stress(2nd worst I have ever had, if you click on my profile you can see my pics of it) and just recently had to buy stronger stuff(TCA peel).  I know that I am not an ordinary case though because my skin is really tolerant to peels.  So I will be using this in conjuction with the peel until my skin returns to normal.( I never had breakouts when I was a teen, just started in my 30s).

I put it on then try to distract myself by sitting at the computer a few minutes while watching my stopwatch. It helps, but it is still uncomfortable.		It also has worked on hyperpigmentation (red residual mark left by acne). Usually those last about a year for me, now they are all gone in about a month or two.		I've stopped using minocycline (anti-boitic --- part of the tetracycline family and is the most powerful anti-biotic they have) and only used Prascion (a sulfur based topically applied wash) a few times. and my face is clear for the most part. My dermotologist said the next step up is Accutane from that.		Right now I'm using this peel once a week, with spot treatments with a Q-tip. This is also good in spot treatment, I should add.		I'd recomend buying the small bottle to see if it works for you, then moving up to the larger bottle afterward.

However, it worked better for me when I just applied it directly on my skin.		For the first minute or 2, after direct application on my nose, I felt a slightly burning sensation and my skin turned a little red.  However, after 5 minutes or more the acid is neutralized and I could see immediate improvement on my skin, smoother and the redness was gone.  I didn't even have to wash it off.		In addition to this product, I washed my face with warm water to open up my pores and then I used Neutrogena's pore refining toner to reduce the size of my pores and to clear old skin.  I applied the gel peel on top of the dried skin toner.		Instead of using acne gel, I used Neutrogena's Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Foaming Cleanser to keep my skin dryer.  Depending on the condition of my skin, sometimes I would only use the skin toner and not the peeling gel.  However, when I saw mild inflammation from acne, I would use both.  The oil cleanser should not be used twice, it would really dry up my skin and irritated it.		In conclusion, I've listened to many stories and tried many different products to make my nose not look like Rudolf the Reindeer.  For my skin, the key was to reduce the oily condition and the size of my pores.  It was the combination of skin oil and dust that clogged up my pores and caused acne.  With the help from Neutrogena's pore refining skin toner, oil-eliminating cleanser, and Skin Laboratory's gel peel, my skin looked a lot smoother and had a healthy glowing feel."

I have had acne since I was about 8. It died down a lot now that I'm in my 20's but my main problem is every pore on my face is big and clogged. Not only that I have what I call ""chicken skin"" on my chest and inbetween the girls, it is flesh colored raised bumps which I'm guessing is also clogged pores as well. I waited 48 hours to do my face because I did just get a waxing done but I tried it out on my chest. There were no visible improvements the same day (obviously) but the next I noticed the bumps had gone down just a bit in size. Also i had small stinging in certain spots nothing that I really noticed because that skin is way different from my face so I could leave it on the full 8 minutes. In the instructions it says that chemical peels will give you cold sores if you are prone to them, I thought well it's not on my face so I didn't have to worry, wrong. I woke up the next day and had one in the corner of my mouth (ouch). So BE AWARE that you will get one if you are prone to them or carry the virus (not the std kind). Second day I did my face, I lasted about 5 minutes and it started burning but not too bad so I rinsed, WORST PART. I felt like the water activated it and my whole face burned so bad, but as I have read other reviews it does go away in about a minute so keep splashing water on your face till it does.	So far so good. Will update again in 30 days."

I applied it to my face for probity 12 minutes (don't do that) and my skin was so soft and my healing acne scars were turning white. Two days later my acne scars were literally peeling off. It did wonders for my acne scars and stunned acne growth for a short time. I moisturized my skin with virgin olive oil and I think that added to the healing and peeling. If you suffer form acne like me let me recommend Green Tea. Overdoes on Green Tea and you will not have anymore acne. Ever since I started drinking green tea no new pimples developed (Its been a week I only have old deep ones left). I stopped drinking the tea for one day and I broke out with three new pimples. Use this every week, use olive oil, and drink green tea and you won't have acne if you suffer from oily skin."
B000PLUZL8,2012,2,5.0,2,3,409,"Tried for the first time yesterday...I'm hopeful!","I'm 24 years old and I have what most people would consider mild to moderate acne. My face really went crazy when I started college. Ever since then, I haven't been able to completely control my acne. I'm pretty sure I've tried everything except accutane. It will get better off and on, but it never sticks. Even when my skin is pretty clear (for me) I still have a lot of redness/discoloration/acne marks. My skin is weird because it gets really dry, especially during the winter months. It's odd because my skin is dry and it breaks out.		I've become pretty good at covering my pimples, but Acne products definitely dry my skin out and make it really difficult to use makeup. In the morning it will look nice, but then after lunch the makeup looks dry and disgusting. I just checked my makeup and it looks terrible on my pimples. I's embarrassing. I want to be able to use makeup to enhance features, not cover them.		Anyways, that's my story. I tried the peel out last night. It burned so bad. I did my best to leave it on for 1 minute. I moisturized afterwards and didn't put on any makeup. When I woke up this morning, one of my pimples had a huge whitehead on it but some of the others were minimized. The skin around my pimples seemed to look a little bit better. As I just said, my skin is dry, but I expected that from this product. My acne is not severe so I will probably wait and try the product again over the weekend.		If you have acne, I know exactly how you feel. It's terrible. I got married last summer and my dermatologist gave me a VERY strong antibiotic to ensure that my face would be clear for my wedding. It was pretty clear, but I could only take it for about a week. I want so very badly to feel comfortable leaving the house with no makeup. None of my friends have acne like I do. They have beautiful skin, like a 20-something should. My skin is also damaged from the sun, because I always felt like the sun temporary cleared it up. It did, but I know it's bad in the long run.		If anyone has any advice, I'd love to hear it. I'm going to stick with this for a while. I mean, why not? What's one more product?"

I am VERY pale and the acne has left scarring which is very traumatizing in itself. I've tried just about everything for my skin- Skin ID (ps don't buy that it's OTC products you can buy at the store, just do the evaluation and it'll tell you what to buy :P) Proactiv, Zeno, every face wash on the market, steaming my face, 10% benzoyl, even prescription creams and antibiotics. Nothing worked, not even a little. I have pretty oily skin and my acne mostly consists of blackheads all around and small whiteheads around my cheeks/mouth/jaw and occasional large cyst like zits that never pop >:[ I decided to buy this peel in combination with the glyco/lac peel because so many people I know rave about how great the peels are. I did this one first, my skin is pretty tolerant to medications since I've had acne for so long so my first application I left on for 4-5 minutes, bad choice. It didn't burn bad until I decided to rinse it off and I blasted the cold shower on my face and the combination of the cold shower and my face burning was so intense I could barely breathe. A few minutes later the burning subsided and my skin suddenly didn't feel oily anymore, but not in a bad way. I used neutrogena healthy skin moisturizer and my skin felt great! I see no differences in acne yet but I also realize it needs to extract the acne before it can eliminate it. Even if it doesn't cure my acne completely the oil elimination is so nice I would buy it again. Giving it 4 stars because I have only used it once- will update! :]		Update- 2 days later-	Skin is slightly flaking, applying lotion often. Breaking out slightly but it is probably just the extraction. I also work out so maybe my sweating has something to do with the breakout although I did the peel post workout because it says not to sweat for a few hours after.		2 weeks later	Wow, this stuff really works! I bumped it up to using it 6 days a week then a week of the glycolic/lactic and it's amazing! It does get a bit sensitive around my nose but other than that I'd say 80% of my acne is gone!"

By blemishes, I mean dark awful scars that come from frustrated nights of picking and popping! Anyway, I was looking for something and anything that would reduce these 'blemishes'. This stuff works! The secret is to use a Q-tip to dap on pimples and scars. Do not rub the solution in a circular motion, DAB it on with a tap,tap,tap motion. Rubbing causes a burn and it seemed to make the dark spots darker. Also, I kept the solution only until it started to feel like it was beginning to burn and then I washed it off, and used the neutralizer (VERY IMPORTANT STEP), after I dried my face, I dabbed on a little Tree Tea Oil. Don't use this product everyday, because it will make your condition worse. Your skin needs a few days between to heal. Miraculously, the pimples dried up almost overnight and the dark spots have begun to shrink, dry up and flake away. I definately reccommend this product! I didn't give it 5 stars because they need to provide more instructions with how to use the product and if you aren't careful, you can really burn yourself."
B000PLUZL8,2012,6,5.0,0,0,578,"Good for Acne","I've suffered from pretty severe acne problems for about four or five years now, and my face hasn't been free of a breakout since before my teens. I also have pretty oily skin, resulting in blackheads and large pores across my ""T zone"" area. I've been to multiple dermatologists to try and solve my problems but with my insurance the most they'll give me are antibiotics that only upset my stomach. I was weary of purchasing this, but I knew that salicylic acid was in a lot of drug store acne treatments and the company advertises this as a ""level 1"" peel, meaning the least irritating. I figured this peel was a good place to start.		When I first got it I was using the peel once a week for fear my skin was going to fall off. I was seeing some results in my acne, but nothing to really say it was a great product. I took a break from using it and when my acne was starting to get really bad again I decided to give it another round, but this time using it once every four days. Once I was doing it more often, I was seeing more improvement in my skin. Does that mean using it once a week won't give you great results? No, probably not. I just saw them faster using it more often, and who doesn't like that? Their website states that you can use it as often as every 2-3 days. I'd say how often you use it really depends on your skin.		As for my results, again, they have been great. For literally a year and a half I had this stubborn pimple on my left cheek that just would not go away. After using this for a few weeks I noticed that the pimple had turned into a white head. Needless to say, the stuff that came out of it was disgusting, but it went away! I also have gotten completely unsolicited comments from my friends and family (Some of whom I hadn't told about the peel) saying how good my skin has been looking, so I know it isn't all just wishful thinking on my part! Unfortunately, I dropped the bottle while doing one of my peels, so I can't say what consistent results past two months really looks like. I have seen the most improvements in my acne, but not so much with any large pores or scarring.		My tips to anyone using this would be...	1. Don't use it right after you get out of the shower. Your skin will be far more sensitive.	2. Purchase a neutralizer with this. A lot of water will do the job to get it off, but strong acids like this will be better neutralized by something specifically designed to do so. (This has a pH of 2.3)	3. Use a cotton or gauze pad to apply it. I tried using a fan brush as suggested and I found it wasn't a very controlled application-not something you want when dealing with acid.	4. Buy an SPF moisturizer. My skin got extremely dry between applications. You'll be very uncomfortable without some on hand. (I recommend the Neutrogena brand)		I won't be repurchasing this simply because I'm looking for something stronger for my acne. If you only have slight acne or the occasional breakout this strength should work beautifully. For my skin I'm going to try the BHA+ chemical peel next."

My skin is reacting very well to this medication. If you have some spare cash then definitely try this :)"
B000PLUZL8,2010,2,3.0,6,11,561,"We'll see how it goes...","First you should know that I have been struggling with acne since I was 12 and have been on everything you can think of and have spent countless dollars on solutions, concoctions, pills that ultimately did not work. I did find some relief while on Accutane, but after 2 rounds of it (2003, 2006). But now, 4 years later, I am still breaking out like I'm experiencing purberty all over again. I decided I didn't want to put my body through the stress of Accutane again and deal with the dangerous side effects. I have so many scars from the acne and new acne continue to appear daily. And being a woman of color, the discoloration of the post acne marks leaves your skin looking horrible. I literally look disfigured. My complexion is so many different shades that I could never leave the house bare faced. I have literally become a prisoner of makeup. To try to help this, I've began to monitor my diet (limited fried foods, dairy, citrus, fats) and increase my amount of water intake in hopes that my skin will notice and clear up. I have yet to see any hope with this plan. So in desperation, I've decided I need to start my skin over fresh. I've had several chemical peels in the past from dermatologist but being a graduate student, I don't have the funds to afford them now. So after doing some research, I found this peel. After reading some awesome reviews, I decided to give it a shot.		I received the 20% salicylic acid on Wed (3/3/10) and decided to use it the very next day (today). I also decided that I would use the peel every other day (3x/week)for 6 weeks before stopping and giving my skin a break. Before I applied the peel, I washed my face with a gentle cleanser using warm/hot water and rinse in cool water. I patted my face with a towel and allowed my face to further dry for roughly 5 min. I applied the peel using a Q-tip and started with my forehead working my way down my face and then to my cheeks. Soon (about 30 sec. into the application) my face began to tingle then burn! I expected this and had a fan nearby. The use of the fan did allow me to stand the peel for approx. 4 min. for the 1st application. I do realize the directions say begin with one min but that just seemed like a waste of time and I could tolerate it for much longer than that, so I did (everyone's face/pain tolerance is different). After I couldn't stand it any more, I rinsed off with cold water. The burning sensation persisted during the rinsing and the towel blotting. It wasn't until I applied Ambi SPF30 face moisterizer that the pain stopped. My face looked the exact same (still acne present and dark spots galore) but my skin did feel noticeably softer. No redness or signs of irritation. What I did notice though, was that the acne that was present was beginning to dry up and become smaller in size. That's a good sign. I repeat I've only used it once so I guess I'll see how it does. I'll check back in 6 weeks when I've had a series of mini peels for a full review."
B000PLUZL8,2012,7,1.0,1,3,199,"Be careful, not for everyone","I started to apply it from forehead as the instruction says but I felt a strong sting immediately.  However, I continued to apply onto my nose and then to my right chin.  During this time, I felt such a strong sensation on my nose that I couldn't bare.  I stopped and immediately wash my face using cold water continually for quite a few minutes because the sensation could not go away.  I was so afraid of scaring my face that I couldn't go to work the next day.  After washing my face for a long while using cold water, I also applied a thick moisturizing mask on my face for over 45 min.  Finally the whitness around my nose went away.  Luckily my face was not scared but I felt very tightness and dryness around my nose now.		My face is oily and combination and has some acnes especially during the summer.  My face is a bit sensitive sometimes but not overly sensitive.  I saw the good reviews and wanted to remove the acnes and acne marks by purchasing this product.

I had a pretty oily skin, thus i used once every two days. I could feel my face started to produce less oil  my face got really dry) but i still was having 3-4  acne on my face and some scars and red marks.		When i was half way through Salicylic Acid, I bought Glycolic 35 gel peel because website says that if used together it will give deeper peel. So what i did was apply Salicylic on my face for 8 minutes and then Glycolic for 8 min( for me salicylic gives me more pain not glycolic). I did this for 5 times, once every 3-4 days depending on my skin condition.		After i used all my salicylic acid, my right side of face was acne free but my left side was still having acne problems. Then i started to use glycolic every once every 3-5 days. I am almost half way through glycolic and on my face i have 2 acne forming, acne free on my right face and two acne on my left face.

B000PLUZL8,2009,4,4.0,1,3,241,"No significant sign of improvment","So, i just purchased this product and arrived yesterday. I NEVER had a chemical peel in my life, so i was really careful with the product. I didn't put the peel on my cheek, i wanted to try the acne prone area: Forehead & Chin first before i proceed. Well, i put it on for 1 min and washed it off with cold water. it feels really cool and refreshing when the product is on my face. No pain or sting at all. After that I rinse it out really well with cold water. Amazingly, the product doesn't try up your skin right away. It just creates like a real thin layer, then i applied moisturizer and went to bed! This morning i woke up, no peel... feels the same. thats why i don't know if this product is really working yet. I need more time to tell. But it does feel really good when its placed on your skin. Think about it! Most acne clearing gels have 2 % salicylic acid ingredients, this has 20% ... so, it has to work in the long run. i'm really optimistic! Will update soon!	_______________________________________________________		After 5 uses, no significant sign of improvment. I love the refreshing feeling of the peel after its washed off. Should i be using this product every 2-3 days ? I'm also using the Glycolic Acid Peel 35% which i feel does create an overnight smoother skin texture."

B000PLUZL8,2012,10,2.0,2,2,254,"Not sure...","I've noticed that SkinLab will respond to comments on Amazon, so this review/question is directed toward their representative:		I've been using the Salycylic Acid peel for about a month now with one application a week, and at this point I don't know if I should continue the treatment.	My goals for the peel were to speed the fading of past acne scars on my cheeks, reduce the size of the pores in my T-zone and improve overall complexion. With that said, I've found that the peel is not painful for me -- it just barely stings -- but the results I've gotten so far are the complete opposite of my goals! My skin is now *extremely* dry, flakey and old, and I've developed acne!! I have acne in areas on my face where I NEVER get acne, and it just won't stop. I looked in the mirror this morning and nearly cried at how blotchy, bumpy and spotted my skin is. I've also noticed that a dark patch of skin has developed over my past acne scars.	I've read reviews that state that skin will get worse and may develop acne before it gets better, but I need to ask for a professional opinion. Judging from my current state, should I tough it out and continue the use of this peel or stop now while my skin is still salvageable?	(FYI, the acne developed around the third week of use. From what I can tell, it is not cystic acne and is not painful.)"
B000PLUZL8,2012,10,2.0,2,2,266,"This stuff is potent, and ""frosting"" gave me scars","I used this a few months ago, left it on for about 3-4 minutes and then washed off with copious amounts of cold water just like the instructions indicated. I'm an Asian-Indian in my late 20s with tan/oily skin and mild acne. I would *HIGHLY* encourage washing off this peel with normal BAKING SODA mixed with water. I don't know why the instructions don't require the use of baking soda, but water alone will NOT wash this off quickly enough. Therefore, if you have 'frosting', the baking soda will neutralize it rather than allowing it to burn/blemish/scar deeply.		After washing off, there was some small areas that 'frosted', meaning that it was still WHITE. I tried to wash it more and more but it wouldn't come off. Eventually, I developed a DARK, DARK, DARK blemish on the right side of my nose.		The blemish still remains almost 4 months later. I can't get rid of it!		Also, this leaves my skin feeling and looking very 'wrinkled' the next few days. Some reviews indicate that the skin will peel afterwards, but mine didn't peel properly so the damaged skin remained.		Now I read some reviews suggesting that the entire face should 'frost'. Are you guys serious?! My experience with frosting is that it's equivalent to burning and scaring.		**For those who have good results with 'frosting', please elaborate in the comments and indicate your type of skin, ethnicity and skin color. These are personal details but very important when using this product. This product can otherwise be very dangerous, even if left on for a few minutes!**"

She tried this for 3 weeks doing it only once a week because she didn't want to over do it to begin with.  It did not stop the acne.  Her face was a mess.  She stopped using it and now we are trying something else. Maybe it would have worked if she did it more often or had a higher % acid, but she didn't want to keep making it worse.  She had as a teenager used the over-the-counter salicylic wash, but it never worked and the Proactive did not work either. I can tell everyone from my own experience with acne that the only products that work for me are the prescription ones with sulfur in them but you have to use it twice a day everyday. Everyone's face is different but this just did not work for her."
B000PLUZL8,2012,9,5.0,2,2,175,"Great Product! Helps My Acne!","I love this peel! I'm a peel novice, so I've never used one before. After a horrible breakout in September due to hormonal imbalances--my entire face was covered, I decided to give this a try. Years of Accutane and prescription medication obviously did nothing, so what's one more try? For the first two weeks, I wasn't really hopeful. It seemed to be working better as a spot treatment than an overall mask. I wasn't peeling, and my acne wasn't going anywhere. Also, it never ""burned"" my skin. It just made me itch a lot. Then I decided to up the time I had it on from 3 minutes to 5, and it worked! I finally peeled, and with that, my acne subsided. I currently only have 3-5 pimples on my face, all of which I'm confident will disappear in the next week or so. I can't believe that this little bottle is all it took to help my acne. I wasted so much money going to the dermatologist over the last few years. This amazing!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,9,2.0,2,2,169,"""Peel"" is the Keyword.","I read all the reviews and a lot of professional sites that all said this was a great product and the recovery time would be negligible. I read several that said the title of ""Peel"" was facetious as most people don't actually notice any skin peeling; others said that the skin would peel the first 48 hours and then look so much better.		I'm here at day seven and my face is still peeling. It seems as though I've lost four layers of dermis. I followed the directions explicitly, and only left it on for a little over a minute. I've never had a problem with dry skin or excessive peeling outside of sun damage. After using this product, my face feels tight and dry no matter how much moisturizer I use.		I'm still hoping for that glow everyone is talking about, but at this point my hope is dwindling. I'm glad this product has worked so well for others, but for me it seems to be a bust."
B000PLUZL8,2012,6,4.0,2,2,174,"Immediate gratification","Arrived on my doorstep in a padded envelope embedded within another envelope. I've been wanting to use a facial peel for so long to combat sun damage, MANY acne scars,current acne, and general dullness.		After reading the instructions, I wiped down with alcohol and used a gauze pad to apply the peel all over my face for a minute. It stung a little but was totally bearable and not bad at all. After a minute, I rinsed with cold water and you could actually see little flakes of skin.		Immediately I had glowing skin - it definitely faded some very light scarring on my cheeks. The larger and more defined scars, however are still visible and hasn't changed much at all. Throughout the day you can see subtle patches of skin peeling off. So don't expect a drastic change at once, but I'm sure with continued and controlled use my scars will look much better.		Definitely a buy. I plan on using this once a week. I'm already super happy with this product. CHYEA!"

I have oily skin especially in the T-Zone and previous problems with uneven skin tone and enlarged pores.	Since getting on a skincare regimen of Philosophy's Purity made simple and the Microdelivery Exfoliating wash my skin looks better than ever.	This Salicylic gel has been a wonderful addition to my routine.	I use it every 6-7 days and leave it on approx. 10-20 minutes.  Yes, it stings, but if it didn't.....it would not be working.  Afterward, I enjoy smooth clearer skin and much less oil production.  My pores are noticeably smaller and I now use less foundation because I no longer have problems hiding blemish marks.	I'm on my second bottle and could not be without this product."
B000PLUZL8,2012,4,5.0,2,2,212,"I love this product!","I have been using this product for 2 months now and my skin feels so soft and looks more radiant. I use it twice a week and the first bottle I used got me 15 uses (2 months)	I used to suffer from acne and used accutaine for 10 months and my skin was clear and felt great for about 5 months, but after that, I started breaking out again (to a smaller degree, but my skin was supposed to be clear for good). I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this product so decided to try it. After the first use, I noticed that my skin already looked more luminous and felt so soft.	I leave it on my face for 5-6 minutes and don't feel much of a burning sensation, but my skin has probably become resilient from the numerous other products I've used over the years. For the first couple weeks, as other reviewers have said, the acid brings out impurities from under the surface and will result in some breakouts but BE PATIENT. If you keep using it, it will shorten the life of the pimple and the breakouts will soon stop.	This product also evens out my skin tone which had suffered scars from past acne :)"
B000PLUZL8,2012,3,5.0,2,2,455,"No pain, no gain","I bought this item a while ago. First, I have to tell you about my skin. I am a Caucasian, 20 year old female with very fair and acne prone skin. Furthermore, my acne is hormonal, and I get painful large red cysts. I have been prescribed hormonal birth control to deal with it, Retin - A, have used 10% benzyol peroxide cream, and EVERY other product out there (Acne Free, among all the other big brands, some of which provided some temporary relief). But basically, I have awful acne that does not go away even with my stringent cleaning and grooming methods.		I am fairly used to strong products, but regardless my skin dries up and looks flaky, no matter what. I decided to give thsi product a try and did use it once or twice, but got impatient with it, so it sat in my drawer for like another month. I decided I spent money on it and I was at least going to finish it. The first treatment was 5 minutes and I did it about once a week and then steadily upgraded to multiple times a week.	 Yes, it burns like hell at first, but I think it's not unbearable and I kept a fan close by to relieve the stinging.		Now, I am using the product every night and leaving a thin layer on overnight. My skin does get flaky still because the product is designed to get rid of that dead surface skin, but HOLY COW. My acne is sooooo much better. My skin is so soft to the touch now, I use far less makeup, and just need to exfoliate in the mornings to get rid of the dead skin. My acne is not all gone, and I have been applying every night for 2 weeks now, but it is almost all gone!		I do still have acne spots, but I will definitely look to this company for a gel peel that addresses those needs as well.		I highly recommend this product and advise that you take it slow at first and DO NOT GIVE up on it, be consistent and safe. It is NOT going to work for everyone to apply this every night and leave it on, that's not how it is designed, but it is as close to a miracle product as I have been able to find. My only regret is that I didn't find it sooner, that I accidentally knocked the bottle over and spilled like half of it out, and that I didn't take pictures to document my progress.		I will repurchase this when I run out, but it does last a long time and does wonders.		YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,2,5.0,2,2,161,"Amazing results!! Biracial Indian/ caucasian skin","I have large pores on my cheeks, black heads, old pigmentation scars. After one use I noticed the scars fading.  My acne is better and my pores are smaller. The scars literally started peeling the next day! After the peeling subsided(3 days) my skin looked brighter and felt smoother. I barely needed to wear makeup! I peeled a few times in September and then took a break and my skin has been beautiful since and has not returned to its prepeel state even after I stopped the peels. It's now nearing April and I am doing a few more touch up peels to target a few new blemishes. I definitely suggest filling the sink with cold water and baking soda to neutralize the acid. It substantially kills the pain when the peel is over and ensures that the product will stop after the time needed. Use deep moisturizer at night and don't pick at it! Let the peel do its job."
B000PLUZL8,2009,9,5.0,2,2,35,"Love it!","I have used this product several times already and I really notice a difference in the texture of my skin.  My breakouts are fewer and Scars are less noticeable.  I would highly recommend this product."

Im going to do another treatment this week and hopefully I will see more results with my blemishes. I didn't get peeling at all NOR burning and this is why I believe I need a stronger solution. Overall this is a great product!"
B000PLUZL8,2009,2,4.0,2,2,140,"a fairly good peel","Shipment was fast and the peel arrived early (in perfect condition). I've used the feel for 6 - 7 times already. I noticed my pores are smaller than they used to be. Acne shrunks quickly and old scars diminished. The colour of my skin becomes even which makes it easier for me to apply make up. However, acne problem worsens after the third peel. I thought maybe it's got to do with the fact I was using a day cream that contains Lactic Acid. So I stopped using it. Yet my acne problem doesn't improve at all. I used to have a mild occasional acne problem but now it looks as if I'm going through puberty again! So, I don't know what went wrong. I'm still going to use this peel though for I'm hoping my condition will improve eventually."

However, after two or three peels using this product I see a difference. My skin is smoother. I have minimal underthe surface pimples. Unfortnately, I am a squeezer so i do have some acne scars especiall around my jaw line.  However, I see these are lighter. I am so pleased.  I also use the lactic peel."
B000PLUZL8,2011,6,3.0,4,5,241,"Not sure if it's me or the product that's doing it wrong","I've heard great things about salicylic acid, but I don't know if it just isn't right for my skin or if I'm using it wrong. I have brown skin, so I'm aware that my skin can react differently to it. The first time I used it, I only did a spot treatment and had it on my skin for 4-5 mins. It turned one of my already dark spots darker, I really hope this is not permanent! Afterwards I didn't notice any peel whatsoever.	The second time I tried it, I left it on my face for less than 4 minutes. Instead of a spot treatment I used a small brush to cover larger areas. This time I did notice a little peel, but nothing to write home about. Plus I had to rub my skin to get the dead skin off 5 days later. And once again, it turned a random spot darker. I don't understand why it only picks ONE spot out of the 20 that are on my face to mess with.	Overall I'm not really sure about this product. It didn't peel my skin, or clear my spots, luckily I didn't get any redness or irritation. I'm giving it 3 stars only because I think I might find a better technique to use it in the near future but other than that this product is a 1. If anyone has any tips please feel free to respond"
B000PLUZL8,2011,4,5.0,4,5,96,"Just like the skin care clinic","I must admit I was sceptical about the product's claims - but it has definitely helped decrease my acne breakouts and has helped to get rid of some bumpy clogged pores, especially on my forehead.  I bought a Groupon recently for a salycilic peel (right before I bought this product).  Well, I went to the skin care clinic, and their peel felt and acted _exactly_ like this product.  For $20 this is a great deal,  now I am excited about trying the glycolic peel too!  Oh and great shipping, it arrived in just a few days."
B000PLUZL8,2011,2,4.0,4,5,294,"Very Goood....requires patience!","I bought this product about a month ago, and have been applying it about 2-3 times a week. I keep it on for about 10 mins. Even till this day, it stings for the first 5 minutes and my skin has not gotten used to the harshness, but I continue to apply it. The results are......slow! After the first week i noticed i was breaking out with more than average acne in my cheeks and chin. I was alarmed because I thought it was doing the opposite than it was supposed to but after reading some other user reviews, I noticed it was a common thing. But thats why i gave it 4 starts because the acne it created was not MILD, rather it was extreme and left me scars (i didnt even poke the acne). But, right away i saw my skin getting firmer and clearer. I have a light brown complexion, so i had some discoloration and it has been somewhat cleared. The acne, it was reduced...i currently have 5 pimples that are in the process of diminishing slowly. Ugh...But it is better than before. Before I would break out with 8-11 pimples on my face and now they have decreased dramatically. I still have acne scars, which have not decreased AT ALL. I have not seen any difference in my acne scars which are still red/purple. But then again, i have only been using this product for about 4-6 weeks and I cannot really determine its effectiveness. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it has reduced the amount of breakouts I have gotten. Overall, I would buy it again....not soon though because i have only used 1/8 of my bottle, so I'm guessing it will lasts me months."
B000PLUZL8,2010,4,5.0,4,5,399,"Gradual but effective results. Be patient!","It seems to me like the most common complaint is that nothing happens with this product. Perhaps these folks need a stronger peel. It is definitely a process to figure out what your sensitivity levels are, but I think it is certainly wise to start on the low end of peel intensity and work up from there. The last thing you want to do is hurt yourself. For me personally, the 20% peel is perfect. I put it on for a minute and peeled ever so slightly for the next day or so. Three days later, I tried it again. This time I tried five minutes. It took about two days for the skin to start peeling and it flaked noticeably for about four days. It's not the same type of deep peeling that I got from the peels I was getting from my esthetician. In that case, I didn't really want to leave the house for days. With the 20%, there was still obvious flaking but I didn't look like I had a skin disease. I definitely prefer more frequent but less intense peels because I don't like having to drop out of my life while I'm doing them. I am thinking you could probably get the same results if you stick with it and stay patient. With more intense peels, you can only do them once every three weeks to a month, but with this peel you can do it weekly. According to the instructions, you can work up to several times a week, but if I did that I'd probably hurt my skin. If you have the extra money and a weekend to stay home and hide out, the benefits of a deeper peel done by a professional is definitely worth the time. You can see pretty dramatic results from just one peel. This isn't that peel, but stick with it and do it weekly and I think you can probably achieve something similar.  Just don't try and leave it on for ten minutes the first time or you might burn yourself.		As for the effectiveness, there's no doubt that peeling your skin yields results over time. I started using this in the midst of a breakout and it has definitely helped clear me up. I starting using peels to control acne, but I don't mind the fact that it helps with aging skin as well."

But as soon as i stopped using it my acne slowed down tremendously, I'm starting to think it was the reason my acne never left those months, I understood that other reviewers said you'll break out before it gets better, well, I broke out but never got better! I kept ATLEAST 6-13 pimples every single day for 3months straight using this product& I'm not exaggerating. I was so sure it was going to work i took pics of my face 1-2 times a week to track the ""progress"" I thought was going to happen, instead i just have 3months worth of horrible acne pics of my face! I was going to make a youtube video of the progress but Since their wasnt Theres no point. If you've used salicylic in the past and it didn't work for you, it probably won't now, What really cleared my acne up to this day is acne.org's regimen &their products, benzoyl peroxide works for my face,not salicylic, now that I know that I won't be touching this product. &i did follow the instructions on this too, also I believe it made the acne scars on my cheeks even darker! Horrible product to use, if salicylic acid based products didn't work for u in the past don't buy this!! Try benzoyl or AHA. If you still plan on buying this I will say if you applying it and having it on your face is a painful bitch wait till you splash water on your face, It's more painful getting it off then having it on!! Something I saw no other reviewers really put."

I didn't expect it to magically eliminate all of the spots that the acnes have left on my face, but I expect a gradual change. In the first month, I did not see clear changes. One disappeared but the other came up. Having read other reviews, I assume it would happen. After 1-2 months, I stopped and started using Origins (serum + moisturizer) and my skin was making much better progress.		Last week, I try to combine the together. I used the peel and then put on the correction serum, then moisturizer. Now I have 3 visits from spots, all of them dark and kinda hurt. Assuming Origins was really effective, I have nothing to blame but the peel. I'm not sure if I should continue it or the spots will get worse...		Demographics: I'm Asian.

After re-reading the reviews on this site, I tried it again last night. This time I applied it with my fingertips and it didn't sting much at all. I have had some bad breakouts on my chin for the last month or two, a couple of which would NOT go away or get better. I was afraid I was getting some kind of adult onset acne or cysts. However, after I used the peel last night, I noticed this morning that those two spots looked MUCH better - less inflamed and well on their way to healing. Plus the large pores I am plagued with are looking tighter/smaller already. I left the gel on this time for maybe three minutes before rinsing off well and moisturizing. I am very happy with what I've seen already and would recommend this product  to anyone who wants to see a real improvement in problem skin - and we all have problem skin in some way, don't we?"

I ordered it Monday and received it on Tuesday.		My skin is not awful. I am not plagued with lots of acne but when I do get a spot its usually followed with a large whitehead. I do have lots of severe blackheads on my nose and chin, which is really why I bought this peel. I also have large pores on my  cheeks close to my nose. Im hoping this diminishes the blackheads and pores!		Before I started the peel I used a cotton pad and rubbed rubbing alcohol all over my face, which ouch, kind of stung. Then I took another cotton pad and wiped a layer of the peel all over my face. I started with my forehead and worked my way down. It did sting, but I had myself worked up about the stinging so it wasn't AS bad as I thought it would be. I lasted a little over a minute and then starting cupping cold water and patting it on my face for probably close to a minute. After I finished with the water I then patted my face dry. I noticed my skin still slightly stinging and tightening for another two minutes or so after I had rinsed with the cold water. After this I applied some Olay moisturizer with SPF 30. I have not gone outside yet or slept yet, so I will give this a few weeks and update!"

I've only used it for 3 weeks (I apply once weekly) and can already notice the difference! I have brown skin that breaks out monthly and leaves black heads.  Even though the blackheads are still visible, they keep dimishing with each peel.  I would caution not leaving it on too long; the longest I've left it on is 5 mins, was trying to go for longer, max 8 mins and it irritated and left a scar when I inadvertently rubbed off the dead skin from not listening to my skin & not rinsing when it was burning.  Overall, I will follow instructions more closely and not try to rush the re-growth.

Most other acne washes and toners I've tried have made my skin actually break out more. Here is what I have been doing: I wash with cetaphil, prep with alcohol swab, then use a cotton ball to apply a thin layer of the salicylic acid peel. I leave it on 10 minutes or so, less if it starts to sting really bad. I then rinse with cold water and apply jojoba oil. I do the peel every 5 days or so. On days I do not use the peel I exfoliate at night using the Olay ProX brush. Then apply witch hazel and jojoba oil at night. In the morning I apply Neutrogena face sunblock lotion instead of jojoba oil and do not exfoliate at all. This is the only regimen that has made my skin show improvement. I do not have any large pimples at the moment, the small bumps are disappearing. I must not have very sensitive skin because I get very little peeling from the salicylic acid peel. A warning though, it did make my skin worse the first time I used it, I almost quit right there and then, but I've kept on and the improvement has been slow but drastic! Im now looking to purchase a glycolic peel to help with hyperpigmentation from past acne. Anyway, love this peel, may upgrade to 30% because I don't think my skin is very sensitive and can handle it."

While it's on it stings/burns, but the feeling goes away a minute or two after you rinse it off. I leave it on for 5 minutes at a time.

This is the only thing i have used that has had a major effect on the large pore festival i used to have on my face. It also did fade dark spot just a little bit the only thing it didn't do for me is to prevent new acne from forming. Not sure if that is bcos i am still in the ""it would get worse before it gets better stage"" but i have seen more breakouts lately with the use of this peel. I also alternate with TCA 10% peel so not sure if that could be it as well. Anyway overall this is a good product. And i do hope to see some improvement with preventing new acne or might have try a higher strength. I am also africam american and will recommend this for dark skin."

B000PLUZL8,2011,2,5.0,5,6,214,"gentle, no.  effective, yes.  worth the pain.","I have somewhat sensitive skin anyway, so I wasn't surprised that this burned rather ferociously the first time I used it.  I'm not very bright, so against the instructions, I used it again the next night.  If I thought the first time was bad, I then became acquainted with what I'm sure is similar to the sensation of 50 bees stinging your face over and over.  It was brutal.  I had to cold water it after a couple of minutes.  I've since used it several times (every 2-3 days) over the last couple of weeks and it works.  It peeled my skin, and as another reviewer mentioned, it made my skin a bit worse before it started to improve.  The pores on my nose have all but disappeared.  The sensation is still slightly uncomfortable but it's obvious that the longer you use it, the less it stings.  Currently it feels like I spread a thin layer of Icy Hot on my face.  I also notice that when I sit and think about it, it's worse, so I recommend doing something to take your mind off of it.  Apply and play a few games of BubblePopp on Facebook or something less lame.  Overall highly recommended and worth it.  Also - you can't beat this price!"
B000PLUZL8,2010,10,5.0,5,6,414,"Fantastic Product","My experience with this peel has been consistent with many of the other customer reviews.  It will take your skin time to adjust.  Your skin will be sensitive and red immediately after use and will then become flaky (using a moisturizer helps greatly but will not prevent this).  After this passes your skin will look and feel significantly better in every way for a few days until you use it again and the process repeats itself.  When I first started using this product, the amount of time after use before my skin would look better was around 2 days.  There is little you can do during this time to hide these temporarily negative results.  I was fairly disappointed.  However, encouraged by the positive reviews, I stuck with it and the amount of time these negative results lasted has gone down considerably (less than a day and during that time it's less noticeable now).		I have also found that if you have acne under your skin that has yet to come to the surface using this will bring them to the surface.  So the next day after you use it you may see some whiteheads that weren't there before.  Don't be alarmed or discouraged, in the long run this is for the best.  It is a temporary setback that will be gone once and for all if you continue to use the peel.		There are two other points I'd like to bring to attention.  (1) The instructions recommend using it 2-3 times weekly.  For me this is much too frequent and I don't feel that there is much benefit to using it this often.  Using it every 5-7 days (I use it every Sunday) is sufficient for great long term results.  (2) The price is a steal for what you are getting.  I have been on the same bottle for 4 months.  From the looks of it I won't have to buy another bottle for another month or so.  So for me it has been much cheaper and much more effective than anything else that I could have used during that time.		I have struggled with bad skin for several years.  It is dries out easily and is naturally oily.  I have tried many other products including Proactive.  Nothing else comes close to this.  After much searching, I have finally found the solution and instead of being embarrassed by the way my skin looks, I often receive complements.  I hope you have the same experience."
B000PLUZL8,2012,2,1.0,7,9,228,"Burnt the crap out of my face","I have used glycolic peels in the past and have used up to a 50% strength with no problems.  I accidentally ordered the salicylic 20% peel by accident (I thought I was ordering the glycolic) and was disappointed at my mistake when I received the product.  After reading other reviews and how mild the product was I decided to use the product anyway.		BIG MISTAKE!  I used the treatment on my chin/cheek area.  I don't think I left the product on for more then 30 seconds.  As soon as I put it on, my face was on fire.  When I looked in the mirror I had several white patches on my face.  I washed the peel off and still had the white patches.  When I woke up the next morning, I had thick brown scabs all over my face.  The biggest scab was on my chin and was about the size of a silver dollar.  My skin felt so dry and it was painful to talk or make expressions.  I practically hid for a week and was so thankful my boyfriend was out of town that week.		Needless to say I will never use this product again.  Please beware of this product - it is not as gentle as everyone states and I do not have sensitive skin as I'd never had a problem with any glycolic peels."
B000PLUZL8,2013,1,5.0,2,2,422,"Great starter salicylic acid peel","I average at home peels bi-monthly with peel types ranging from lactic acid (40%), glycolic (10%), and now this salicyclic acid peel. I've had one TCA peel done professionally a couple years ago and that was the deepest peel I've ever had (and did that thing hurt like none other).		The problem I'm trying to solve with this peel is scarring on the sides of my face and these bumps on my right jawline that I think are dormant cystic acne lesions. They are usually not inflamed but they are bumpy, as if there's something underneath each one. Once in a while they will get inflamed and swell up as active cysts. I've never had any good advice for this problem, not from derms nor various estheticians. I hope to use this peel to wear down the bumps and purge the cysts.		With that background, this salicyclic peel is rather mild for me. I've done this about three times. There's a bit of stinging but it's about the same as the lactic acid peel. It's not unbearable at all for me. My routine starts with a double-cleanse; the first one to get rid of my make up, and the second to clean as if from scratch. I've used my Clarisonic on one occasion. I did not notice any difference with the peel in that instance. I first apply to the thicker areas of my face that coincidentally need the extra peeling -- sides of face, jawline -- then I do the T-zone starting with the forehead them the nose area. The skin around my nose is much thinner and that's where I notice the tingling the most. I leave it on for about 5 minutes, then I add more to the jawline area where I have cystic acne and some bumpy scarring. I leave it on for another 5 minutes or so and then I neutralize with a baking soda and water solution and wash with water. I don't find that I need to use a cleanser afterward, but I do moisturize. I do not get any sort of frosting whatsoever but my skin does get red so it only looks marginally better immediately after the peel. The next morning, my skin looks much smoother and even. It's most noticeable in my forehead where the skin there is smoother and has minimal spots to begin with.		The bumps do feel a bit flatter after the third peel. I'm hopeful that they'll continue to get flatter or come to head with continued treatment."

B000PLUZL8,2013,0,5.0,2,2,350,"Too soon to say for sure, but so far so good!","I just received this product yesterday, and I immediately did the patch test. Much to my relief, the product did not burn like I expected it to. This morning the area wasn't in the least bit red or dry, so I decided it was okay to use on my face. When applying, it feels warm immediately. For me, it tingled about 30 seconds in, and then by a minute it was a warm stinging. Unpleasant, but nowhere near intolerable. I left it on for three minutes and it didn't sting any worse than the one minute mark. However, when I went to rinse, the second my skin made contact with water it burned a surprising amount. Luckily, I read around a lot before purchasing, so I had a mixture of baking soda and water ready. I splashed that over my face and the burn stopped immediately, along with the initial sting. (You can purchase the neutralizer it suggests, but why spend the 20 bucks (S&H) when baking soda works just as well?) I rinsed for a minute or two, making sure to be 100% thorough, then followed the directions by patting dry with a cotton pad and applying Cetaphil. Now I've applied the moisturizer about three times in the six or so hours since using, but my face isn't flaky or red whatsoever. If anything, it already looks better! I'm excited to see the long term effects of this product and as of right now, I highly recommend it.		UPDATE 1/18/13: I've now used this product three times, once a week since I got it. So far the burning has increased with each application, but I'm assuming that's because my skin isn't as tough as it was the first time. It's still not an intolerable burn though, as long as you use the baking soda and keep up on applying the cetaphil whenever your face feels even a little bit dry the day you use the peel. My skin isn't perfect, but I've only done three applications - it does look noticeably better, so I'm standing by my initial review."

This peel is very much professional grade and burns like .... well you know.  I've had a chemical peel at a spa and this peel burned much....MUCH more than those but it is also more powerful.		When I use it I do see immediate results but it is WORKING, believe me.  The next day I get dark spots that are as big as a quarter and it resembles a chemical burn but then it begins to peel.  I help my skin heal by using hydrocortisone cream 2-3 times a day and this helps the skin peel itself to reveal your new, baby-soft skin underneath.  Be sure to do it well in advance of a big day."
B000PLUZL8,2012,10,4.0,2,2,442,"Smoother skin!","I read some reviews before I bought this product and the majority of people like it so I gave it a try.  I am 28 years old and have battled acne for the past 10 years.  I've tried many many products - over the counter and prescription.  I used Proactive for years and then that stopped working :(		I have been using the peel about every 5 days or so for over a month.  My blackheads are still there but I have noticed that my skin is smoother and is less likely to break out!  (After I do a peel I don't break out after, my skin does the opposite thankfully!)  Like another reviewer said, its a process.  This isn't going to solve all of your problems in one application.		This product is NOT for everyone.  I do NOT have sensitive skin.  This product does NOT make me bruise, incredibly red or make my skin turn brown like other reviews.  If you know you have sensitive skin I would say this isn't for you.  I had no problem applying it to my entire face right from the start.  You should gradually ease into the product by slowly increasing the amount of time you leave it on every peel you do.  Yes it burns badly but you have to do something to distract you while its on lol.  My face still burns after I rinse it off, apply a ph balancer, rinse that off and apply a cream....beauty is pain!		I'm glad I read other reviews because I created my own ph balancer for after I rinse the peel.  Like other reviewers I created a baking soda paste (just add water) and I apply that to my skin after I rinse the peel off.  It is gritty so you can't rub it in, it'll irritate your skin.  I just apply it with my fingers and let it sit for a couple of minutes then rinse it off.  It helps with the burning!  I actually mixed the baking soda and water and put it in a small plastic container and keep it in my fridge so I don't have to make the paste for every peel.  It keeps in the fridge just fine and its nice and cold on my face after the peel!		I like the product and will continute to use it!  It hasn't eliminated scars or blackheads yet but I'm hoping.  My goal is to have clear skin so I don't have to wear makeup..maybe thats a lofty goal.  Even if it doesn't, its still a great product for people prone to get blemishes.

I am a 25 year old female, and throughout the last 3 years I have had major on and off problems with acne. I don't know why, and it has severely bothered me seeing as before the age of 22 my skin was almost always perfectly clear. It was something I was regularly complimented on. SO these mini-breakouts I've been getting, mainly appear on my forehead, in clusters of very small little zits. Nothing would make them clear up. If they did, new ones took their place. I wash my face every morning and night, I mosturize, I tried many different exfoliants...Even my visits to dermotoligists, and taking prescription Retin-A did not clear my skin. Nothing. Has. Ever. Worked. Then, somehow I stumbled upon this product. It has changed my life. :) My skin is back to how it once was, pre-mid-twenties. I am simply amazed. Now, I can walk out of the house and I don't even need a speck of makeup. As of right now, using the product only SIX times (once every 5 days) there is not a single zit, red mark, bump, or pimple ANYWHERE on my face! :D		Of course, as other reviews say, the product does slightly burn.

I started having fairly bad acne and needed something to help it out. I bought this along with Dudu Osun black soap. I used the peel a couple days a week for about a month then just once a month. I haven't needed to use it for the last 2 months. Since then I gave it to my friend, who has the worst acne I have ever witnessed (cystic, infected, blackheads, you name it), in hopes it will do a little something for him. (I'll see how it works for him and update in a couple months)	I don't know if it was the reduction in stress in my life, getting more adequate sleep, not being a teenager anymore, eating more fruit, or just the soap and always using clean cloths to wash, but I only get spot breakouts that are small and go away quickly, which I can live with. My skin seems to always be improving with just using the soap, literally only the soap. I don't moisturize, use the salicylic peel, face masks, nose strips, or any acne wash or cream at all anymore. Just the soap everyday in the shower. I do think the salicylic acid helped give my skin a jump-start though."

B000PLUZL8,2010,6,5.0,2,2,119,"Worked like a charm! Molluscum Contagiosum gone in 3 days!","I bought this stuff for my sons molluscum contagiosum. What typically takes 12-18 months to get rid of, is nearly gone after only 3 days! I can't say enough good stuff about it. Simply apply it with a Q-tip 2-5 times a day to the molluscum areas & they miraculously begin to dry up & go away. This is our second bout w/ this molluscum stuff as my kids are both on the swim team & my daughter got it last year. Unfortunately, I couldn't use this stuff as the molluscum was on her eyelid. I used an herbal product that worked, but was quite expensive and took about 6 months to see results. I highly recommend this stuff!"
B000PLUZL8,2010,5,5.0,2,2,282,"Finally Something that really works! Amazing","This stuff is amazing.  I am 32 and have had consistent mild acne since I was 11 - nothing could control it! Laser treatments, antibiotics, proactiv - you name it I tried it.  I was hesitatant to try something else since nothing ever worked - but for less than $20 it was worth a shot.  I added this to my regime of items that had seemed to help a little in the past and saw some results after every treatment. It was not immediate but my face got a little better after each treatment - Then after the first complete round of treatment (6 weeks) the results were amazing.  My face is 99% clear and I can get rid of/prevent more acne with the solution if I feel a problem area starting.  For the first time I am in control of my face - my skin tone looks much better too. It is amazing and the price is even more amazing.	So no pain no gain right - so it stings/burns like crazy annd I had to slowly increase the time to the full amount -(careful around the nose and mouth) stand with your face in front of a fan that helps, wash really well with water and then immediately use moisturizer and the burn goes away. After the first few treatments I felt a little sensitive to the sun so I tried to stay in the shade the day following but that went away with use. My skin tolerates spot treatments as needed but be careful and make sure your skin can tolerate the extra treatments.  I wish I had found this years ago I will never go without it again."

I use this on Monday and use the TCA peel on Wednesday. My acne has improved alot, my skin is getting better every week I use this. I have been using the TCA peel 4 months before. TCA peel seems to work better with the Salicylic acid peel. I wished that I have known this along time ago."
B000PLUZL8,2010,1,5.0,2,2,229,"This stuff works!!!","I have had problem skin forever. In 2006, I went all out and spent money on a plastic surgeon to remove some scars and then underwent expensive acne treatments in his office.  That only lasted as long as I kept going to his office for the treatments. Once I quit going within weeks my skin looked terrible again and the scar came back just a bit. So since then I've had terrible skin. I was willing to spend so much money on it and I just tried to deal with my skin condition using over the counter products UNTIL I discovered this Salicylic Acid Peel. It's been 3 weeks since I bought it. And wow, what an improvement in my skin. The scar area is about to fall off right now. My pores are significantly smaller. My oily skin isn't oily anymore. The overall condition of my skin is such an improvement.  Just in the nick of time too because I have an important event coming up and I will look great in my new skin.  This stuff works. Try it out and see your skin condition clear up and improve overall. I have one wrinkle in between my forehead which I haven't had luck getting rid of but I'll continue to apply this and see if it improves.  I'll keep you posted.  Best product I've found on amazon.com."

I followed up with the Neutralizer PH Balancer and a 70% Sunblock to further protect my skin.  I have no more over 40 year old acne and everyone notices the difference.  Because of the high concentration of Salicylic Acid, you can feel it working immediately, and see the dead skin removal  as you apply with a cotton ball.

Biore would temporarily get rid of the blackheads on my nose, but nothing ever got rid of my whiteheads.  I've tried all types of inexpensive to expensive facials, creams, and gels. I can only stand leaving the peel on for about 30 secs to a minute.  Afterwards, I wash it off with a ton of cold water. I use moisturizer and that's it!  Right away I could see the difference.  My blackheads got a lot smaller, and my whiteheads weren't as bumpy.  I'm hoping after a few more treatments, they'll be all gone.

Prior to using the peel, my skin was so damaged with blemishes and painful zits, to the point where makeup no longer covered them, and my skin was so patchy it was embarrassing. Nothing was working for my acne. Finally, I tried this peel and it has changed the way I feel about my face. It diminished the size of my pores, completely gained my natural skin tone back, and almost completely got rid of the zits only after 4 weeks of use.		The first time I used it, I followed the instructions carefully. Leaving it on only 1 minute. There was a stinging sensation but nothing too painful or unbearable. After rinsing it off with cold water I dabbed the Neutralizer skin pH balancer by Cellbone and rinsed that off...then pat dry face. I immediately saw a huge difference in the size of my pores. They were completely closed!		Continued the treatment every two days and about 2 weeks later noticed that my skin tone was no longer red from all the acne, my face didn't hurt due to acne, and my acne was completely gone! Now, due to my high stress levels I got two measly little pimples but they don't hurt or look as massive as they used to. I am very excited to have found this peel. I'm on my 5th week and will stop shortly after next week. I recommended it to my friend and she's in love with it also.		You should definitely try this product! you've got acne to loose! :)"

I don't have cystic acne anymore, I just seem to get the hormonal acne around my chin and jaw line. I just put a dot on every pimple I have after I wash my face. Then I wash it off after 5 minutes and then put on an oil free moisturizer. It's been working ok, dries out my pimples but they're still pretty red. I get scaring from my pimples (hyperpigmentation) and I've been using the glycolic acid 35% on the dark spots as a spot treatment as well. They're both definitely better than just using face wash and 2.5% SA or BP spot treatments that you can get at the store so I'm happy with it."

I recommend using only the 0.025% or 0.05% tretinoin gel to facilitate a gentler cell turn-over. It can be purchased real cheap on the web. DO NOT buy this product, it is not worth the chance of getting a chemical burn like so many reviewers have had!

B000PLUZL8,2011,7,5.0,10,10,445,"A Very Satisfied Customer","I have inherited oily, acne prone skin from both my parents. I had my first breakout at the age of ten and it progressed regularly until my mid-twenties. I now have about one breakout a month and the majority of my face now has very large, clogged pores. Over the years I have tried several name brand and not-so-name-brand over the counter treatments. I visited 4 dermatologists and have tried antibiotics, prescription topical ointments and birth control. None positively impacted my skin and, in fact, the ointments irritated my skin. I chose to try this product because it's a stronger concentration than the 2% solutions at the drugstore and I know salicylic acid is lipophilic. I needed to get rid of the built up oil and dead skin cells to help get rid of the gunk in my skin.		I received this product last week and have used it twice. I followed the directions that were enclosed in the packaging and also researched the procedure by reviewing information and videos produced by board certified dermatologists. Both times I cleansed my skin with a gentle cleanser, patted my face dry and used an alcohol prep on my face to remove any excess surface oil on the skin. I measured about 1.5 mL of solution and administered the product using 4x4 gauze and gloves, starting with the forehead and working my way down my face. When I was ready to remove the peel I rinsed my face with copious amounts of cool water and then patted my face dry with a clean towel. Afterward I used a moisturizer with SPF 50. The first peel stayed on for 1 minute and I only noticed slight tingling on part of my forehead. The second peel stayed on for 2 minutes and I noticed considerable stinging in the exact locations where my pores were largest and most clogged - nose, cheeks, chin and part of my forehead. My skin in these areas was a light shade of pink after rinsing.		Today is the day after my second peel. My super large, clogged pores appear smaller with less gunk and the small pimples I had last night are now gone. I don't even see redness in the areas where they were. My skin is no longer the light shade of pink it was when I finished the peel and my skin texture is softer that it was. I have never seen results with a product this quickly. I am VERY SATISFIED with my results and will continue to use this product. It's such a relief to have finally found a product that can really penetrate pores and deliver a great result."
B000PLUZL8,2007,10,5.0,13,14,38,"Great product","Best price I found, super fast delivery. Great product, my breakouts have really diminished and i'm only on my second application, comes with full instructions and works greeeeat! will definitely continue to buy more of this supplier's products."
B000PLUZL8,2008,6,5.0,9,9,99,"Great product","I used a wide-tip paint brush, poured a little of this acid in a glass container, and painted it on. The first time I left it for 15 minutes, the second and third times I left it on for about 30. I should have bought the 30% because it doesn't burn how other people have reported, but it does make my complexion clear for a while. Makes me look younger for sure.. I love this product and will continue the application, but with the stronger dose next time. But for people with delicate skin this is probably very good."
B000PLUZL8,2011,4,5.0,8,8,197,"Just like a profeshional peel!","I have had bad acne since I was in elementary school, a decade and a half later I finally cleared most of it up with proactive. That would have been fine if it weren't for my obsession with picking every pimple that I have ever had.  To date I have probably wasted around $15,000 on peels, laser treatments, creams, and derm abrasions, only to have the acne flare back up and have scars return.		I bought this product a few weeks ago and was extremely hopeful yet very apprehensive. If $15,000 can't help the scars what will an $18 bottle of acid do?  Magic, that's what it will do! I have done 2 peels so far and have seen a large reduction in the red scars, and the deep pock marks have a less cavernous appearance. I continued to use proactive and only had a small amount of actual peeling. On the other hand, my skin is very tough.		So far I love it! It is gratifying to watch the scars fade with each peel, even more exciting knowing that that same peel would cost me upwards of $150 if I were to go to a dermatologist."
B000PLUZL8,2011,5,5.0,11,12,330,"GREAT product","I am so surprised by what a great product this is.  I take meticulous care of my skin, use a good moisturizer daily, get regular facials, and even a few med spa chemical peels this year.  The spa chemical peels were HARSH and actually terrible for my skin.  it burned and flaked for days, and after?  Just about zero difference.		I came across this peel in a search for a new skincare product.  My skin is oily in the summer, dry in the winter, and has some uneven redness that I usually cover with foundation.  I've been using this for just a few weeks now and I see a great difference already.  It's not a miracle product but it definitely seems to work.  Just be sure to read the instructions carefully!!  You can only use this product at MOST every 5 days, I would recommend once per week.  Your face should NOT be wet with the product- it almost goes on more like a toner, with a cotton pad wiped across the skin.  You have to be very careful to keep it away from eyes, nostrils and mouth.  And the product shouldn't be left on for more than 8-10 minutes, MUCH less at first.  You have to build up gradually with a product like this.  Start small, rinse off well with lots of cool water, and moisturize immediately.  Avoid any scrubbing within 24 hours of using this- I tend to exfoliate my face like crazy, either with a face scrub or with a washcloth, but the peel exfoliates your skin so any more will result in irritation.  I learned that the hard way!		Really worth trying.  I've tried all sorts of skincare products from just about every brand out there: Fresh, Philosophy, Murad, Proactiv, Ole Henriksen, DDF (which is awesome but not for this), Skoah, Dermalogica, Skyn Iceland, etc etc.  This is a far better value and really works, no frills.  I plan to buy the bigger bottle next time!"
B000PLUZL8,2008,10,5.0,10,11,159,"It actually helps.","I never had much acne growing up, but it would seem that each little pimple left a mark on my face. Most of the people I know kept telling me that the scars were ""barely"" noticeable. Still, noticeable enough for me. So I went through a laser treatment and I noticed an improvement of 30% to 50%. I wasn't impressed: scars were there still.		So I did a bit of research and bought this product. I was reluctant to use since my skin is very fair and sensitive. To my surprise, I was able to handle it very well: ten minutes, twice a day. After nearly a month of use, I can say that many small scars have disappeared and the big ones look flatter and softer. I will keep using this product for sure!		Note: Don't expect results overnight, you have to be very constant and wait at least 3 weeks or so to see how it works."
B000PLUZL8,2011,11,5.0,7,7,768,"Love this peel","I was nervous when I first applied this peel, I thought I was going to burn my face off. My skin is also really sensitive, it gets irritated very easily. However, I did not end up burning my skin at all, and I did not have any other adverse reaction (skin peeling/flaking, irritation, etc). Although, I did take it slow (I left the peel on for less than a minute for my first use). I have gradually been increasing the time I leave the peel on for, you do build up a tolerance to it. My face does not stay red (for long) after use, I just apply Cetaphil spf moisturizer following immediately after.	Basically this is my regiment:(I apply it after I shower in the morning)	-Wash my face with green tea cleanser (it's best to use a cleanser with out moisturizer or anything that will leave a residue on your face, it affects the efficacy of the peel).	-I apply witch hazel toner to my face with a round cotton pad. The toner helps remove any excess oils on your face (I read that oils on your face can also prevent the peel from working as well). It can make the peel sting a bit more if your face is really dry, so use discretion when choosing to apply a toner. My face gets really dry, but I want to get the maximum benefit from the peel so I use the witch hazel.	-I also apply vaseline (I use the kind that has cocoa butter mixed in, it smells so good!) around my eyes and on my lips. I us it as a precaution, I'm clumsy so there is always a chance I could accidently get the peel in my eye or on my lips. Lol!	-Once the witch hazel has fully dried, I begin applying the peel. I just use a round cotton pad (not the same one I apply the toner with, I get a new one out). You can get the cotton rounds at walgreens or any drug store, usually in the beauty section.	-After I apply the peel to my entire face (It usually only takes me a few seconds to apply all over) I set a timer. Once the timer goes off I rinse my face with tons of cold water. When I dry my face I do so gently, and I dab the towel on my face I do not rub.		 So for my first time I set the timer for one minute after I applied the peel. But I ended up rinsing the peel off before the minute was up, just because I felt the peel beginning to tingle and I was so scared that I was burning my face off! I began rinsing my face off with lots of cold water. I dried my face, then immediately (gently) applied my moisturizer. My face remained a little red for a few minutes but wasn't bad. And to my suprise everything went well! My face didn't burn off, my face didn't remain red for long, I had no peeling! I have become more comfortable using this peel and also leaving it on for longer periods (I left it on for about 2 minutes and had no adverse reactions) I noticed right away that my skin felt a little tighter. Now after I use the peel my face looks much better, it has this kind of renewed fresh look to it. I don't know exactly how to describe it. I didn't realize how awful and worn out my skin had started to look! I needed to get all that old damaged skin off. My skin seems to have gotten a little lighter, I think the sun damage has begun to fade a bit.	My acne has not diminished entirely, but I would say it has gotten better. My acne scars seem to have become more smooth, my face doesn't looks as ruddy. I wasn't expecting a miracle to begin with. My face was/is pretty bad. I'm 26 and I have adult acne, and I'm beginning to develop fine lines and wrinkles. My face had begun to develop that tired damaged look. I know it will take quite awhile for my skin to look as great as I want it too (need to see a dermatologist someday!), but this peel seems to be helping it look better for now. Overall I am pleased with this peel! It will take awhile to get the full benefit from the peel. I've only been using it for about a month, but I see slight improvement."
B000PLUZL8,2011,0,5.0,7,7,320,"MIRACLE product","I've used this product for about 6 weeks, once a week, and without the slightest exaggeration, this product has CHANGED my skin.		I'm 17 years old and have very sensitive skin. When I was younger I suffered from SEVERE sun damage in Florida that has plagued my skin ever since. My biggest complaints about my skin (before this product) were : BLACKHEADS, enlarged pores, blotchiness (resembling rosacea, but not), lost elasticity, oily shine, and tons of underground bumps on my forehead.  It's not that I had a face full of acne, I just have never been happy with the quality of my skin. People told me that it was genetics, and nothing could ever change the way my skin was, and it really freaked me out because my skin was the source of a serious lack of confidence. But THEN, I read great reviews for this product, so I decided to try it out.		 I didn't really notice much change until maybe 2 weeks ago, and each day it keeps getting better. The first 3 times I used this product, I was in total shock because it took off dead skin that was still just sitting there in the crevices of my nose.		Now, my blackheads are virtually gone.....I thought I would never be able to say that. I don't have to wear make up anymore to feel pretty, in fact, I feel better without it. I swear, I'm just an all around happier person because I'm not always feeling self conscious about my skin. People have come up to me and asked if I underwent some laser treatments or something because it looked like I had a different person's skin.		I really hope you try this product! You will not regret the purchase. I cannot believe that it is only 18 dollars. EIGHTEEN dollars. Man, if only I found this product years ago so I could have saved hundreds."

After trying any and every product I could get my hands on, I decided to try a peel.  I have very sensitive skin, so I was a little weary at first, but the 20% solution has worked great for me so far!  The first time I used it I could only leave it on for about 30 seconds.  (The stinging was a little more than I had expected.)  But even after leaving it on for such a short time I have had great results!  My face is not nearly as oily as it was before.  I used to get really shiny about an hour after applying my makeup, but now my face looks great throughout the day.  And the number of pimples has also dramatically decreased.  I would strongly suggest using this product."

As soon as I'm done using it, my skin it much softer and there is usually minimal visible peeling.  Definitely worth a try if you suffer from acne.

Update: After I wrote this initial review, I went back to some terrible breakouts. I then knew that I was not fixing the problem from the inside out - but only the outside in. I did some research and believe I had a Copper/Zinc imbalance now for many years due to my Copper IUD. I started taking a daily Zinc supplement of 50mg. Then I do this peel once a week - leave on for about 5 minutes. Then I use California Baby Diaper Rash Cream (i know it sounds weird) and put that on my face. Diaper rash creams contain Zinc - which is really good for skin health. My face is now flawless and the red marks are diminishing fast. I wish I would have done this routine years ago - and saved myself a lot of heartache. One thing to remember if you try this- it took time. I have used this peel now for almost 3 months, and zinc for almost 2 months. It takes time - but it will be worth it!!!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,3,3.0,1,1,172,"Seems to be good for blackheads, but acne scars still stand","I have used this product for about 7 weeks now. At first I tried the recommended of one application per week but apparently the solution is not as strong as some reviewers made it out to be. I ended up changing it to 5 days and now I am actually seeing a minor difference. I also had to change it to 8 minutes (max application time) right on the second time, because it was honestly not doing anything otherwise.		However, the only change has been the elimination of blackheads. While that is pleasing in and of itself, the main reason I bought this item was for my acne scars (merely a few small hardly-noticeable bumps) that I have had for around 5 years now. I read some reviews and some claimed they had their long-time scars removed by this product. I do not believe it has done the job yet for me, but I am hoping to be proven otherwise in the coming weeks. I had pretty high hopes for this item"
B000PLUZL8,2012,2,4.0,1,1,296,"Great Product","I've been using the Salicylic Acid peel for a month now and I really like it. I came off of accutane last year and still have some lingering scars and dark spots. I'm also starting to see my first fine lines and wrinkles. Even though my face is completely clear of blemishes, I still have to wear makeup because I just don't have pretty skin. I was about to get a medium depth TCA peel from my dermatologist, but I just couldn't bring myself to take a week off of work to recover! So I started browsing the internet. This peel got such fabulous reviews (and was such a low price) that I decided to give it a shot.		I was so terrified of burning my skin off, that I literally put it on for 10 seconds the first time! That obviously did nothing, so each time, I bumped it up to a minute, then two, and so on. No matter how long you leave it on, immediately, your skin feels softer and more smooth and it just appears tighter. I don't think it's anything anyone else would notice, but my satisfaction is enough for me!		I didn't start seeing real results until I kept the peel on my skin for at least 5 minutes. That time, I got noticeable peeling over the next couple of days-it reminded me of what I call ""accutane skin"". If you've ever taken the drug, you know what I mean - dry, a little itchy, flaky and a little pink. Several days later, you start to see new, softer skin appear. Since I've been using this peel, I haven't even had to use concealer, as my skin tone is significantly evening out.		I will absolutely continue to use this product!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,2,5.0,1,1,39,"Good for spot treatments","This stuff is really good for reducing the size of huge acne. I have had very fast results.		I do get some minor visible peeling. In addition, this stuff can be very painful.		I probably would buy it again."

I have been using this for a few weeks now and LOVE it! It does make my skin peel and burns a little bit while applied to my face, but that is to be expected with a ""peel"". I have been seeing great results. I have also started to use this on my chest and it has been working great there too.		This product is NOT too harsh at all and doesn't burn my face (leaving it red for days) like other products have. I also haven't seen negative reactions to being in the sun. I would recommend this to everyone as a starter and if you feel you need something stronger move to a different strength then.		The directions that come with it are less than desirable and look rather unprofessional."
B000PLUZL8,2012,1,5.0,1,1,228,"Works Amazingly Well","I have had breakouts for most of my adult life.  I am 41 years old and wondering when all this was going to stop!  I bought this thinking that it will help to get rid of the zits finally.  Well, I was not let down.  Number one, it does burn pretty good.  I have a high pain tolerance (four kids...natural childbirth) but it does burn.  Remember to keep fanning yourself once it's on.  Also, once you rinse off with very cold water, it will continue to burn for a few more minutes.  I use Nivea Soft moisturizing cream afterwards because it has the vitamin E and jojoba oil.  I felt that my skin was tighter and pores were smaller.  In the two weeks I have been using it, there has been no new pimples.  Your face will peel but its like really dry skin.  Not very noticeable, I went to work the next day with no issues.  (The Nivea can be put on under foundation too to help with the flakiness/dryness)  I actually look forward to the burn, knowing that it is transforming my face.  I use a brush to put it on as a cottonball soaked up to much into itself and didn't feel like I was getting an adequate amount on my face. I will continue to use this and hope to see even more results."

Even if a product took away many of the actual pimples i was still left with very bumpy skin.  I used this product for the first time last night, and im not going to lie, it burned like hell. i could only keep it on for about 2 of the recommended 8 minutes. it was burning so badly i found myself running around my house trying to cool my face down lol. i washed it off with water, and it was still burning so i applied a pH balanced toner which took all the burn away. I noticed results right away. It burned away all existing pimples and i woke up the next morning with people commenting on how great my skin looked. For me, its a miracle cure.  just make sure you remove the mask the second your face turns red and frosting begins. great product!!"
B000PLUZL8,2012,1,5.0,1,1,152,NICE!,"I like this stuff a lot.  It's strong enough to do the job, but not so strong that it leaves me in pain or with rashes.  I've used it on my face, thus far have not exceeded 1 minute, once a week due to the intense ""tingle"", & it works for minimizing pores & getting the top layer of dead skin off the surface (a nice, smooth feeling & appearing result).  Also, I've used it on my family's keratosis pilaris (those hundreds of tiny bumps on the backs of our arms) & it has produced some results there as well (they seem to be clearing up).  No tingle is felt on our arms, I've only felt the tingle on my face.  *Note: I am a licensed cosmetologist & have received esthetics training, but those willing to READ, follow instructions & be patient should do fine applying this product & receiving its benefits."

I use it about 2x a week rubbing it on the area with a clean q-tip. I leave it on for only about 45 seconds, until it starts to burn, then wash it off with water. There is no redness and it has cleared up the area so well. I highly recommend it."
B000PLUZL8,2010,2,5.0,1,1,127,"Great product!","I bought this peel for my son who has moderate acne and also for myself because I have bothersome blackheads I can't seem to get rid of no matter what. I did the peel a couple of days ago and I can already tell a difference. I don't believe I put enough solution on my face though or on my son's face for fear that I would over do it so I believe next time we do this I will be sure to put plenty on. It does burn quite a bit but I believe it's worth it for the end result. My face is just starting to peel and I'm excited to see how it will be after a few more treatments, especially for my son."

I had tried one from another company (my review of it is on here somewhere) but this particular company is 100%.  Beware, though, if you're not used to using this, it's seriously powerful stuff.

Unfortunately, after using the product a second time, I developed red, bumpy skin around my chin that still has not gone away (it's been seven weeks as of today, Nov 30).

B000PLUZL8,2012,5,2.0,3,4,396,"Makes My Skin Dry and Peel","I have had this product for several months and while I really wanted to love this product, It just doesn't seem to work for me.	At best, this product works ""okay"" as a spot treatment (maybe a 6 out of 10). Sometimes I can apply it at night to a developing pimple and the next day it will be gone, but other times, I will apply it at night and the pimple will still develop the next day. It works best on ""mild"" pimples, which is disappointing because I bought this hoping to reduce the appearance of what I like to call my monster pimples (cystic pimples). It seems to have little to no effect on these.		I have tried using this product as a full-face peel and it is one of the most painful experiences I have ever put my face through. As the directions instructed, the first time I tried the full face peel, I kept it on for one minute and I was in absolute agony the entire minute. My eyes teared, my nose ran, it felt like I was holding my face over an open flame. I was terrified I had burned my skin. Fortunately, it only felt like I had and while a little red, my face was not drastically damaged. My skin did build a small tolerance over time and I could stand up to 6 minutes with this peel on my face; however, keeping this on my  face for so long resulted in my skin peeling between my eyes and around my nose and mouth. Peeling so badly that I could moisturize in the morning and half-way through the day, I could touch my chin and find flakes on my fingers. It was very embarrassing. I realize these are sensitive areas; however, these are the areas I get white/black heads and I as hoping this peel would help reduce these, since it wasn't working on my cystic pimples. Nope. My skin peeled, but the white and black heads remained.		I am a 20-something woman with combination skin and have what I consider mild-moderate acne on my face (the rest of my skin is perfect). Maybe this is for people with oily skin, or severe acne, or mild acne, or something that I don't have. I have stopped using this because for me it causes more damage than it fixes."
B000PLUZL8,2011,11,5.0,3,4,246,"A Miracle in a bottle!","I love this product! I am 35 year old Hispanic female. I have been dealing with cystic acne for the past few years! Within the last 6 months, my acne had gotten really bad. My jaw line and neck was filled with painful cystic acne. I was on a bunch of topicals as well as oral antiobiotics. Nothing seemed to help. A friend mentioned this product and I decided to try it out.		After the first application, I noticed a dramatic change. The cysts began to shrink and within a couple of days from the 1st use, the pain was gone and the cyst were gone. I have used this peel 3 times already. The first time, I left it on for 3 minutes and rinsed it off with cool water. The peeling began the next day.		If you have cystic acne, give this a try! It is not hard to use.		Wash your face with a gentle cleanser, do not exfoliate. Pat dry. Apply the peel starting at the fore head. Down to the neck line. Because I was new to the ""peel"" world, I let it sit for 3 minutes and it was a bit uncomfortable. Fan your face and it will help. Rinse with cool (not luke warm) COOL water. Pat dry with paper towels. Let face completely air dry and then apply moisturizer. YOU DONT HAVE ANYTHING TO LOSE!!!!		I am now going to start to alternate between glycolic and salicylic peels!!!!"

Anyway this product is working. I probably threw away about 400 dollars getting beta peels and chemical peels. Then i wondered if I could get those kind of results for less and bam, I found this product by Skin Laboratory. I didn't even know you could use it twice a week and I will start doing so. For all of those that are skeptical.....DON'T BE. give this product a shot because you will no be disappointed. And for those wondering if it works on African American, well it does cause I'm am.

I wash my face three times a day with salicylic acid acne cleanser and I've been using this product for four minutes once a week. Then I use an AHA cream around my eyes for my fine lines.

And it is not that I am not patient.  I've been using it for 2 months now.  And i use it religiously for 2 - 3 times a week, 5 minutes each time.  My exiting pimples are gone faster then usual but they leave red scar for a long time while the new ones keep popping out.  I remember some of the reviews describing the occurrence of the new pimples so it did not bother me too much since i thought it'll stop eventually but after two months, the new ones still come out near the area where the old ones are and it is ANNOYING!  I also have questions about whether or not I should use mask (from other brands) or acne cream in between the usage of the Salicylic peel.

I've worked my way up to the full eight minutes, and the burning isn't to terrible.		I highly suggest instead of buying a PH stabilizer, use baking soda. Baking Soda is a natural acid neutralizer. Way back in the day it was drank to help with heartburn (it tastes nasty by the way, but better than tums). I make a paste out of it, and slash it on my face. For the first second it will burn like fire while its neutralizing, however after that all the burning will be gone.		For moisturizer I use thick coco butter. Then during the rest of the week I combine the butter with Retinol cream. I wait a day after the treatment to put anything harsh on my face. Let me tell you your skin will itch after every treatment. It's not a bad itch, it's mild and wont last past the first day. All of this might vary for you. My skin is not sensitive at all due to years of worthless Acne treatments.

I have had acne since I was about 13 and have tried literally everything under the sun. I mean EVERYTHING. As a teen I went to our family physician and was given topicals. I have also tried every brand of acne abrasive soap, gentle soap, scrub, toners, lifters, tighteners, clay masks, rubbery peel masks, over the counter pills...ect. I even tried doing nothing to my skin for an entire summer. No makeup, no special soap, just bare natural. You get the idea. I tried everything. Nothing worked!		I had all of given up at ever having clear skin at the ripe ol' age of 25. On a whim I decided to give it one more go. I hopped on Amazon and started looking for products that focused on evening skin tone rather than getting rid of acne (I was more or less convinced that I will simply never get rid of my acne). In my search I stumbled across acid peels. I was very skeptical about using something so drastic and abrasive, but the customer reviews were raving about the product, so I decided to do a bit of research.		The product is a bit pricy for purchasing on a whim, but I was desperate. Besides, I have spent 100s of dollars over the years on products that didn't work, so what is another $18? Right?		I am very glad that I took that fateful chance. Using this product is still a love/hate relationship, but for the most part it is love. My skin is much more even toned since using it and it looks much more fresh and youthful. It is also the ONLY thing that will clear up my face with record speed.		Now for the hate part - When using this product be mindful that your skin is going to look horrible for about a week after using it. I mean horrible! It dries everything out and you will have very dry, flaky, gross skin that will make you want to hide in your house for 5 days.		To combat the effects, I have a few pointers. Lotion, firming masks, rubbery peel masks, hot showers followed by rubbing the dead skin on your face, immediately followed by lotion. Oh, and liquid make up. Powders will just magnify the dry skin.		Trust me, once all of the dead skin is gone, you'll love how fresh and beautiful your skin looks. It is worth the effort."

B000B6VIPY,2010,9,4.0,1,1,34,"not bad","it didn't get rid of all of my ingrown hairs but has definitely helped!i will definitely keep using this as it doesn't dry out my skin like some other products do. it's all natural!"
B000B6VIPY,2010,7,3.0,1,1,24,Princereigns,"This product was okay.  Didn't notice much difference when hubby used this.  His skin responds much better to Billy Jealousy Hydroplane and Shaved Ice."
B000B6VIPY,2010,6,3.0,1,1,24,"Not working for me, maybe for someone else?","This product didn't work for me.  Maybe it works better for other people.  But, it did leave my skin feeling very soft and smooth."
B000B6VIPY,2010,1,2.0,1,1,66,"Not good.","Ive been try all the after shaves i could get my hands on to try and remove razor bumps and none of them work including this one. This one works the best out of all that ive tried but it doesnt remove all the razor bumps and the redness comes back after 4 hours. I had high hopes seeing as there are so many positive reviews."
B000B6VIPY,2010,1,3.0,1,1,93,"Pleasant smell, not the most effective","I have been using this product for about 2 months now.  I get very bad ingrown hairs and need something to help me control them.  This product smells nice, goes on easily, and when applied 2-3 times a day, it did help the bumps go down.  But when I run out of this, I will definitely be going back to Tend Skin.  For the price, Tend Skin is much more effective and lasts a lot longer.  This just simply isn't strong enough to completely get rid of the ingrown hairs and razor bumps."
B000B6VIPY,2010,1,5.0,1,1,26,"Pricey but well worth it","A bottle of this stuff is pricey but it works better than any other product claiming to do the same thing. Smells pleasant and isn't greasy."
B000B6VIPY,2009,11,4.0,1,1,122,"Iffy for a second purchase","Ok, so I know I gave this product 4 stars and then I say that it is iffy if I would repurchase this item...contradictory??? Allow me to explain, I give it the 4 stars because it is awesome if my legs are really itchy from all the hair trying to regrow, but I don't feel that it prevents the ingrowns, maybe it helps to soften the skin to allow the hair to break through, but I find I achieve maxium results by exfoliating and then using the product. After I'm done with it I am going to try only exfoliating and see how I fare...more to come! ALSO, another reason why I liked it, it really helps reduce the redness from epilating!"
B000B6VIPY,2009,7,3.0,1,1,46,"Did alright","It seemed to help relieve some of the bumps, but not all of them. I was skeptical about the size, but it lasted a long time, which is a plus. I probably won't buy it again, but overall not a bad product. Might work for others."
B000B6VIPY,2009,5,2.0,1,1,116,"Another Strike Out","I picked up this product at a store that I work at and was pretty excited to try something that might actually work.  See, I have razor and ingrown hairs all over my legs and being a girl.... well lets just say it not nice to the touch.  I've just used up my first bottle.  I still have dark spots, none of that improved (perhaps it would work better on the face?).  It helped my ingrown hairs some, however I still had a significant amount. I've so far tried everything from AHA to glycolic on my legs after I've shaved and so far no luck. I've just ordered tend skin... so I have my fingers crossed."
B000B6VIPY,2009,4,4.0,1,1,56,"Good product, but over inflated shipping price","The product is great and does the job, but you do have to use it regularly in order for it to be 100% effective.	The shipping cost seems to be higher than the actual cost of having it shipped, I noticed the tag on my package was less than $2, but I was charged around $4."
B000B6VIPY,2008,10,2.0,1,1,30,"Not a solution","I purchased this product months ago and still have ingrown hairs.  Yes, it does soften the skin, but the problem still exists.  This is not a solution to the problem."

B000B6VIPY,2006,11,5.0,1,1,38,"Good stuff","Pricey, shipped quick but well worth the dough.		It worked for me and my face was jacked up plus i had bumps on my neck which wasnt cool. I cant say enough about this stuff its good stuff."
B000B6VIPY,2009,10,5.0,3,4,587,"so far - better than most","when you have severe ingrown hair problems at least for me my goal is to be open and try most everything. in another post i gave thumbs down to tendskin but i gave it four stars because i could see some results but tendskin burned my skin very badly. maybe it will work for you though. after reading hundreds of posts on various products i chose princereigns because many people were getting results and it didn't denote many ""burns like hell comments"". while i applauded previous posts for warning away from this product because it was not 100% natural as stated, costly or plain didn't perform, when you have severe/painful ingrown hairs, again you try most anything once. for starts the little bottle is small and lasted me about 6-7 weeks. while it is a small bottle because it is a gel i never wasted a drop rubbing it in - big plus. i would like to see this product in a roller bottle none the less as another method of applying the gel. while somewhat costly my goal was to find the lowest price and free shipping. ordered my 2nd bottle and both times were shipped/recv'd quickly - under 5 days and shipping was free - that was reasonable. total price w/shipping $20.00 - reasonable. my plan of attack was first to see if my face would tolerate the product or the burn test. no problem with burning and princereigns did a rather good job of soothingly - big plus. even directly after shaving and liberalling rubbing it in good i had no problems at all with burn - this is very good. i used it twice a day in the morning right after shaving and at night before bed. the first week i noticed my skin smoothing a bit. it was like the little pores in my face were closing. would i have liked my skin to be like my 8yr old son's skin, yes but realistically my face appeared to get smoother certaining better that it was before a few weeks of this application. i used the product faithfully and liberally over all my shaved areas which is about 3 squirts X 2times daily X 7days a week. is more better, i don't know. slowly and i mean slowly one ingrown here and one ingrown there would either disappear or become smaller. after 4weeks about 20% ingrown hairs were gone. miracle no but will i take those results anytime. during the 4-5week, i still plucked a few really deep stubborn ingrown hairs.  with about 1-2 weeks left of the first bottle i am convinced and satisfied it worked. my wife and some friends made a point of saying my skin looked clearer/smoother after a month of usage. ordered 2nd bottle and the plans are to keep using the product at least another 2 months. i figure about 3months should be a good gauge as to where i'd like my face to be. i do agree with some posts that it does a somewhat decent job of evening out ones skin tone. the smell was absolutley acceptable and not so overwhelming that it would wash out ones cologne or parfume. of course i am still researching other products (like anthony's logistics,min ny solutions2) and will keep you posted after 3 months (12/31/2009)of princereigns. so yes, i would say give it a try and see if it works for you. for now i would say so far so good - this product is better than most."
B000B6VIPY,2009,6,5.0,3,4,208,"Miracle in a bottle","This is the first product review I've ever written. I always mean to write them, but life tends to get in the way.		I was compelled to write a review for the Prince Reigns gel. I was skeptical about this product but desperate nonetheless to find something that would help me with my ingrown-hair problem. I heard about it in a beauty magazine (and read that Gisele Bundchen, who is quite often modeling in bikinis and underwear, uses it!) and thought why not. I've been trying my whole adult life to figure out how to get rid of this problem.		I cannot believe how much it has already helped. The hairs have straightened, and the itchy bumps have disappeared. I have pale skin, and have some embarrassing scarring from previous ingrown hairs, which the gel seems to be help lightening. It is quite literally a miracle in a bottle for me! I never thought I'd find something to help this. I'm beyond relieved and thrilled.		One tip -- be sure to use the gel as the bottle says, both morning and night and after you wax/shave, to make sure it works to its fullest potential.		P.S. Don't worry about the price of the bottle -- it lasts forever!"
B000B6VIPY,2007,2,5.0,41,43,107,WOW!,"I have only been using this gel for about four days and already I'm seeing results! My hair tends to curl and hide under my skin, plus it's usually thick hair. I have had an ingrown hair for, I don't even know how long - probably years, I always had a huge bump and I would try to dig out the hair with no luck. After two days of using this gel, all of the sudden, a long hair emerged from this bump in my skin and the bump finally went away! I recommend this to everyone ... I am buying more for my friends and family!"
B000B6VIPY,2005,7,5.0,48,53,127,"Too good for words","I had heard of this in LA before and its in all the goodie bags at these award ceremony's but It was never available to us regular folk. I had tried Tend Skin (horrible) and It just burns the hell out of my skin. Princereigns worked miracles for me in 2-3 days. It removed all my ingrown hairs and bumps and I also had those little dark dots where hair is starting to grow and I didnt notice them anymore. I can go 3 days without shaving or trimming down there now and its not noticeable. WOW, living in LA I am ofetn in a bikini or top with sarong so it is key for me. I highly recommend this stuff for all the girls out there."
B000B6VIPY,2007,4,5.0,28,31,66,"Ingrown Hair Gel or Serum?","I ordered this product and received a serum. So it says on the bottle.	Anyway, I like this product. It's more effective then Tend Skin and you don't need cotton rounds to apply it. I use epilator (a device that pulls hair out at root level) on my underarms, legs and bikini line.	This product came in handy. I've never had an ingrown hair ever since."
B000B6VIPY,2007,5,4.0,15,16,178,"Not perfect, but pretty damn good","I've held back on reviewing this for a while because I wanted to make sure it worked over the long term.  As it turns out, it does-- to an extent.  I like the fact it is natural and doesn't leave a burning sensation, but it does tingle (it might in fact burn if you have sensitive skin).  It works like it claims and teases out a lot of ingrown hairs, and tones down the red spots, but it does not entirely remove blemishes and dark spots from previous cases of ingrown hairs.  Since removing the hair depends on how fast your hair grows, it's effectiveness as a ""remover"" can vary.	It's helped me a lot, but it's not a cure-all for ingrown hair and bumps.  While expensive, I find that I don't use that much (but I don't use it for legs), so one bottle will last me a long time.  The gel is surprisingly thick and spreads very well.  If you need something for a very large surface area, you might want to try something more economical."
B000B6VIPY,2007,4,5.0,15,17,498,"Huge Raves for Princereigns gel!","I am probably the last one of all of you to find out about this product, but I'm blown away by the results I've seen. I had never heard about it until I just sort of stumbled upon it about 3 weeks ago. I had some ingrown hairs in my eyebrow area, & needed something to help this. I had heard about ""Tend Skin,"" & went online & read about it. I had fully intended to buy this. However, I was browsing the internet, & typed in ""ingrown hairs,"" and the Princereigns info was brought up. I was intrigued about this product being in several magazines like ""In Style,"" etc., & the fact that there was info that Angelina Jolie uses this. I think that her complexion is gorgeous. I then went to several of the beauty boards to read reviews, but couldn't find any. I then went to Amazon.com, & read testimonials that convinced me to give it a try. It is supposed to remove bumps on your face, as well as dark spots & ingrown hairs. I began to notice a difference in my complexion the second day, which is hard to believe, even for me. Some of the bumps that had been there for years were just gone, and my skin looked so clear. One bump just went away, leaving a long hair that had been clogged in it. I've had so many problems with my skin the last few years that I've been going to a spa and having lactic acid peels and facials. However, the peels are very expensive, and I've noticed only a very small improvement. I've used this product now for about 3 weeks, and have already ordered three more bottles. I am sort of rationing it until my new bottles come in. I don't want to be without this gel ever. The lady that does my peels and facials is going to be disappointed that I don't have to come back, but my complexion has not looked this good in years. In fact, I don't think that I'll  have to even wear foundation pretty soon. I'm truly amazed at this product. It doesn't burn, sting, or have a strong smell, etc., and is made from aloe and natural fruit ingredients. When I am just around the house, I don't wear makeup, and have used this product about 3 times a day, rather than the 2 times recommended. Also, I find that only 1 thin layer massaged in well is enough for 1 application. I wash my face, and then let it dry. Then I apply the Princereigns, and let it dry before I put my foundation, which goes on smoothly over this. When I wash my face with cleanser, I use a warm wash cloth, and very gently massage it over my face. I can see big knots of white, like an imbedded blackhead roll out. Like I say, I'm blown away by this product, and just had to rave!"
B000B6VIPY,2012,4,5.0,6,6,323,"Ingrown-free is the way to be!!","I'm African-american and my specific hair texture is prone to getting ingrowns around the bikini area. Let me tell you, I've gone to many-a-really high end spa in hopes of finding professionals who are more ""clean"" than your downtown nail shop. Turns out, I get ingrowns no matter where I go or how much I spend for my brazilians. Lucky for me, a new brazilian wax salon opened up near where I live. I tried them, it hurt like hell, but totally worth it. After a few visits, I got comfortable with my wax lady and I asked her what to do about ingrowns. She applied some of the soothing green Prince Reigns gel for me right then and there, and recommended that I purchase a bottle from the front. She also told me to apply to my bikini area three times a day to prevent ingrowns. I decided to give it a shot, because it felt great when she rubbed it in. It didn't burn, AT ALL, even though my skin was screaming from being freshly waxed.		I have NOT had an ingrown since. For real.		And I would also like to mention that I did not apply three times a day.  I'm horrible at routines, and I bareley do it everyday. I do it every other day-ish, and I have not had an ingrown since. I. LOVE. THIS. STUFF. It's cool and soothing and goes on smooth.		The only slightly (but barely) negative thing I would say...is that for me, it has not removed the scars from previous ingrowns. I don't mind this though, because like I said, I wont be getting ingrowns ever again.		One last caveat...I've tried TendSkin before.  TendSkin makes my skin look crazy; it peels and turns an ashy grey, and it is so dry that it's brittle to the touch. GROSS.		hope this helps! I've never written a review before! :-) there's no spell check?! lol"
B000B6VIPY,2009,3,1.0,46,61,151,"Contains only all natural ingredients?  I guess it depends on how you define natural","If you don't care what ingredients are in your cosmetics and what you put on your skin, then this review is not relevant for you.  For those of you who do care, beware that the ""only all natural ingredients"" advertised on the Prince Reigns website aren't that natural at all.

I never had to worry about ingrowns. Three months ago, as I was looking for good deals for Tend Skin, I came across Princereigns on Amazon and read all the positive reviews. Most people seemed to have a positive outcome, plus it was gentle and had pleasant smell. I thought ""can't go wrong, I'll try it out."" I was never unhappy with Tend Skin but it did dry out my skin so I was open to trying something new and Princereigns seemed promising. Girl, was I wrong!!!  I didn't know how great Tend Skin was in preventing ingrowns until I stopped using it and started to use Princereigns. I gave Princereigns three months to redeem itself...that was too long!!! I was way too optimistic. Currently, I have so many bumps and ingrowns, it's too embarrassing to wear a bikini bottom! I have never had so many ingrown hair in my life. I just received Tend Skin in the mail, and hopefully, it'll help my waxed area clear up before I take my vacation in 3 weeks. I'll be sure to use extra moisturizing lotion when I use Tend Skin. I'm never going to use Princereigns - I wish there was a money back guarantee. Even my husband who uses Tend Skin on his face got more ingrowns while using Princereigns.

I used it once a day for the 1st year or so, now I used it every 3 or 4 days.  One time I stopped for about 2 weeks, and those bumps started coming back.  2 of my friends at work started talking about having the same problems I did and I told them to try this and they did, and are amazed.

If you dont notice any difference at all, then dont buy it again but to me,  $25 total is sooo worth it to get rid of those horrible bumps!  And now it lasts me several months since I dont use it as much, so $25 every 3 months or so is not bad for the relief!"
B000B6VIPY,2007,11,3.0,5,6,80,"Works, but no extreme results","This does work, but you gotta be really consistant. I apply this after i use the epilator, and it does sooth the skin.. my primary purpose of buying this was to get rid of my ingrowns, it soothes the ingrown spots when its hurting, but I haven't experienced anything the good reviews told me. I still get a lot of ingrowns, and it gets a little sticky right after you apply it, gotta wait a little before putting on clothes."
B000B6VIPY,2007,6,5.0,5,6,110,"good stuff","Really good stuff.  I just switched from TendSkin to this.  Not because TendSkin doesn't work, because it does work very well, but because it seems this stuff lasts longer.  Which of course means I'm switching because of the slight cost difference.  But yeah, this stuff really works great!  I would think for starters one should use it twice a day, then after a week start using it only once a day and you'll get great results.  I like how the bottle is designed as well, the bottom lifts so you don't have to tilt it upsidedown when the bottle is almost gone to try and get that last bit out."
B000B6VIPY,2007,0,5.0,5,6,105,"If you have not tried this product you're missing out.","Now I finally have the look and feel of a celebrity.  The best product on earth period!  I've tried all ingrown hair product's since 1985 beleive me Ive' spent thousand of dollars, nothing comes close to it ""forget about it"" Saliylic Acid is history in my book. Sorry Dermatologist their is a cure.  I bought 1 bottle before christmas 2006.  Since the new year 2007 started I've already bought 2 bottle's and I'm spreading the word.

I apply this to the area after I shave and no more red bumps or ingrown hairs.  My husband is African American and I recommended he use it on his face after shaving.  He just started using it and it works great for him too!  A little goes a long way.  I've had this bottle for over a year and still have a lot left.  I don't use it everyday though.  But now that my husband is using it, I may have to buy more.  I also like that the scent is not too powerful, it is light.  If you have problems with razor bumps or ingrown hairs, this is the product to get."
B000B6VIPY,2010,5,4.0,2,2,29,"It works","I've tried Tend Skin and a bunch of others but I've been using this for about a month and it really works better than anything I've ever tried. Recommended."
B000B6VIPY,2010,0,5.0,2,2,202,"Amazing, Amazing, AMAZING!","My entire shaving life I've dealt with razor burns, ingrown hairs, and bumps. Even so I've been way too much of a chicken to wax or sugar. Up until this product I pretty much avoided tanks and swim suits, which is fine for the area I live in. But I found myself having to move to sunny southern California and I became a little bit panicked. My sister had used this product before and referred it to me. By this time I'd used my fair share of serums, natural and chemical. None really worked, but Princereigns...wow. WOW!!! No more bumps, no more razor burns and no more ingrown hair. The level of excitement I have at the results is almost ridiculous really, but I've NEVER been confident wearing a tank or swimsuit and now I am! So happy! I'll be using this stuff forever and recommending it to everyone I know.		The bottle says to apply twice a day, but I'm so forgetful I only do it once a day but it still fixed my problems! I shave less and the bumps and whatnot were gone after 4 days. FOUR DAYS! Try this stuff, it's not expensive so give it a shot!"
B000B6VIPY,2009,9,2.0,2,2,26,"Not sure what was suppose to happen","i did not his this worked at all for ingrown hairs. It felt good after shaving, but did not do waht it was supposed to do."

B000B6VIPY,2008,8,5.0,1,2,125,"Great Product + Great Service = Very Happy Customer!!!","I am really happy with this product. It arrived before expected and works really well. I waxed my bikini area and got several very bad ingrown hairs. I've been using the serum for about a week and can see a significant difference. Some reviews say the product didn't work as great as expected; I suggest they be more liberal with the application. I noticed results after 3 or 4 days of use, but when I applied more (2 pumps instead of 1) I saw even better results. The product is a little costly, but for small areas like face and bikini it will last a while. Definitely highly recommend. I've already told several friends about it. Overall, I'm very happy with the product and service."
B000B6VIPY,2008,4,4.0,1,2,92,"Not bad","It really helps the ingrowns grow out. A bump would come to the surface and then heal after just a week of use. It smells good, and feels good going on. Dries quickly. Waaaaay to expensive though. I used this for full leg bikini application and it only lasted about 3 weeks with daily use. The other thing is that it leaves a kind of film on your leg, which isn't noticable when it's dry, but when you shower, it gets kinda slimy. Weird, but doesn't affect the effectiveness of the prodcut."
B000B6VIPY,2008,2,4.0,1,2,48,"Great but not enough for the price!","This stuff really is better than Tend Skin or other anti-ingrown gels. I do think it's made a noticeable difference after one or two weeks. The problem is that there's not enough in a bottle! Or, alternatively, it's too expensive. But it's nice stuff. Warning: does contain parabens."

I've now used all of my bottle of 'Princereigns' and I'm afraid my ingrown hairs haven't improved much at all. It's a nice product to apply just after shaving as it soothes the area but if you have serious ingrown hair issues like me then save your money!"

I would never buy it again."
B000B6VIPY,2012,2,1.0,0,1,79,"not worth the $$","This gave me really bad, painful cyst-like bumps. I stopped and started using it again 3 times before I was sure it was the product. I was also disappointed with their ""all natural ingredients"". Also, did not see much improvement otherwise. It did take away some of the redness but the bumps it left were so awful that it took about 10 day for them to clear up. I do not have what I would consider sensitive skin either."
B000B6VIPY,2012,2,2.0,0,1,117,blah,"I was really looking forward to using this stuff and really had faith in it but, nope. I have been using it for a good month or 2 and there are barely any results. I'm not sure if i'm just convincing myself there are slight results or there really just aren't any. It was a disappointment and a waste of money, totally not worth $20-$35. I also read some reviews of people saying it smelt good. It doesn't even really have a noticeable smell i'm not sure if that is a pro or a con I guess that depends on the person. All in all I wouldn't recommend anyone to get this unless it was like $10."
B000B6VIPY,2011,11,3.0,0,1,45,"Didn't do much","I've used Tend Skin for years, and decided to try a bottle of this to see how they compared. I do prefer that this is a gel rather than a liquid, but it just didn't seem to work as well. I'm back with Tend Skin."
B000B6VIPY,2009,4,5.0,0,1,169,"Awesome product!","I really adore this product, I use it all the time. I really gets rid of the red bumps on my legs that I get from shaving and also just from dry skin. I most often see results the next day, and sometimes after two days of use. I also love that you don't have to use it all the time, only when you need it! This product also helps to soothe and heal ingrown hairs, so I find it really useful when I get my legs waxed.		Some people have said in other reviews that the product is a little bit sticky after use, but that only lasts for a minute or so...If it's more than that you're probably using too much. That's another great thing about this product; you don't need to use a lot to see results.		I definitely recommend this product to people looking to get rid of red bumps or ingrown hairs. For me, it even moisturizes my skin, and softens it. Five stars!"

It works"
B000B6VIPY,2009,4,5.0,3,4,134,"Great product, disappointed in shipping method used","WONDERFUL PRODUCT!! I have struggled for years with ingrown facial hair (especially on my neck). I have used dozens of products over the years and I find Princereigns to be the best to help control and eliminate ingrown facial hair on my neck. I have used this product for about 2 years and couldn't be happier with the product!!		However, my only complaint is the shipping method this reseller decided to use. They shipped the package to me via USPS with SIGNATURE REQUIRED. This made it VERY inconvenient because I had to make a special trip to the post office to SIGN and pickup this package. I will not use this particular reseller again since it is not convenient to make a special trip to the USPS office to sign and pickup the package."
B000B6VIPY,2009,4,3.0,3,4,140,"Just okay","I read several upon several reviews regarding the effectiveness of using Princereigns Ingrown Hair Gel and I have to say I'm fairly disappointed. Now maybe it's just me because I come from a German-Italian background and have rich thick black hair and fair skin, but it really didn't do much of anything to stop ingrowns. When I first used it there was a slight improvement (I used it every day). It smells nice and feels good on the skin, but I thought maybe my skin needs to breath so I cut back to just using it after I shave and the results changed to not effective at all. For something that costs so much and has had so many great reviews I was expecting a lot more than it making ingrown spots a little less noticeable and feel slightly better."
B000B6VIPY,2008,3,2.0,3,4,66,Hmm....,"I used this product every time I shaved for two months. Barely any improvement. Not sure if it's just me, but I won't be purchasing this again. I prefer PFB Vanish, maybe because it's a little harsher. I used it for one week and it was worked much better. Less red bumps and hair that comes in is sticking out straighter so it's easier to shave/pluck."
B000B6VIPY,2007,10,5.0,3,4,100,"It works very well.","Im a long time tend skin user and once I stopped using tend skin and started using this....I noticed a dramatic improvement. Tend skin works..dont get me wrong but it didnt suit my skin type it would dry me out all the time and cause me to have an itchy face. This stuff does not dry me out, has no unpleasant smell, and can be used on acne and it works very fast. This stuff easily replaced the tend skin in my opinion, remember they both work but this has a lot less of the drawbacks that tend skin has."
B000B6VIPY,2007,2,5.0,3,4,70,"It really works","I used to get ingrown hairs after I shaved and although I still get a few, this product has exponentially decreased them.  It is a little more money than other products but it actually does work!  I use it every time I get out of the shower, even when I do not shave. Give it a shot, I truely am a happy customer and am about to reorder another bottle."
B000B6VIPY,2007,6,3.0,4,6,41,princereigns,"The product didn't exactly work for me. My ingrowns are still the same, even if I do exfoliate and apply twice a day. Maybe it works differently for everyone. However, I was glad that it sort of lightened the dark spots."
B000B6VIPY,2012,5,2.0,2,3,127,"Product Advertising Does Not Have Full Disclosure","I wish I had scanned all of the reviews prior to purchasing and seen the one where the ingredients are listed. Neither the amazon.com listing nor the product website provides a full list of ingredients, which should have been a red flag but I took a chance because the price compared favorably to my usual choice, the ingrown hair serum sold by European Wax Center which actually comes in a nearly identical bottle. However, this product unfortunately contains parabens, and it seems disingenuous to advertise it as ""natural."" While there is still question around just how dangerous parabens are, there are enough other endocrine disrupters I'm potentially exposed to every day that I don't need to voluntarily add another one, especially when I have alternatives readily available."
B000B6VIPY,2010,0,1.0,2,3,148,"Not for me...","Obviously, this product works for some people - but it definitely didn't work for me!  I bought it at the spa where I get my Brazilians - it was highly recommended, so I had high hope for it...plus, for the price I figured it must work. Wrong!  It did nothing for my ingrowns...in fact, I kind of think it may have made them worse.  I thought I would have to stop getting waxed they were getting so bad! I decided to try a different product (fyi - Tend Skin) and seriously - no more ingrown hairs! I don't know if this is a testament to what a great product Tend Skin is or what a crap product Prince Reigns is, but either way I will never go back.  Now I'm just trying to figure out how I can get rid of my half used bottles of Prince Reigns..."
B000B6VIPY,2009,11,5.0,2,3,93,"Love this stuff! No red bumps!","I have always had a problem with the bikini area. I have tried every diffrent way to remove the hair but always had bumps and ingrown hairs. I tried Tend Skin first and that did help some, but nothing like Princereigns. This stuff cleared everything up. I still get some ingrown hairs but nothing like before. When I do get an ingrown hair the gel seems to clear the skin up quickly. For the first time in my life I have a smooth, clear, bikini line. I would definately suggest trying this product."
B000B6VIPY,2009,5,5.0,2,3,93,"Very Good product it reduces the bumps and it WORKS","I have used this product for over 2 months now and it really does reduce the bumps and irritation. I have shaved as well as use hair remover and it has always kept the irritation down as well as reduced the bumps. I used to have a lot of red bumps after shaving and I would put lotion on it and other things but it would never reduce or make the bumps go away. I tried this product and after using it the bumps went away and stays away. I love this product."
B000B6VIPY,2009,10,5.0,7,8,194,"Wonder Gel","I have had issues with bumps caused by ingrown hairs from my late teens to my early thirties.  I went to a dermatologist years ago and got a shot in my scalp and took some ointments that helped for a long time but it was expensive.		Years have past and the bumps came back to make matters worse, I was invited to a wedding and I always shave my head and the bumps are here again in all their pain full glory.  Any one who has had these kind of bumps on the back of their scalps and their faces can tell you how pain full and how much these bumps itch.		I have used TendSkin in the past but it burns and leaves my skin really dry, With the wedding coming up and the itching driving me nuts, I jumped on amazon.com and eureka I found the wonder gel and here comes the great part I have only used it for two days now and the itching has stopped and the bumps are shrinking, I recommend this product to any one who wants to get rid of the bumps caused by ingrown hairs."
B000B6VIPY,2007,4,4.0,7,8,60,OK,"Dries quickly, and has soothing aloe which is good especially if you have razor burn. Works pretty good I think. I put it on after my shower. A little goes a very long way. There's no odor, and very thin when applied. Absorbs almost immediatley. It's worth it if you don't want nasty ingrown hairs or razor bumps to show!"
B000B6VIPY,2006,11,5.0,4,4,35,Super,"It is pricey but hell I woulda paid double cause it cleared up my face in 4 days and I cant tell you how much of a pain ingrowns were to my skin.		GOOD STUUFF"
B000B6VIPY,2009,3,1.0,6,7,86,"Does Not Work","I bought this product because I have ingrown hairs on my bikini line and have suffered from them from many years. I bought this product not expecting a miracle, but atleast a little change. I am almost done with the bottle and i see NO change or difference at all. It does sooth the skin, but for the price it is definetly not worth it. Save your money and do not buy this product or be fooled by these positive ratings. Dont say you werent warned."
B000B6VIPY,2009,1,4.0,6,7,148,"An amazing improvement","I purchased this product after having suffered with chronic ingrown hairs on my bikini and stomach areas. I often had one or two on my stomach that would be there for months as a huge inflamed red thing that wouldn't go away. I'd tried alternatives, like Bump patrol and bikinizone which didn't work that well, and pfb vanish which worked slightly better. However, after applying this for a few weeks my chronic ingrowns disappeared (leaving an inch long hair coming out) and didn't come back (or if i did get another big one, it only lasted for a few days). I've also started using an exfoliating brush, one that is very stiff and you use when dry. That, combined with princereigns has gotten my skin back close to normal. My life has literally changed with it. I'd recommend using it with the brush, and being consistent. Good luck!"
B000B6VIPY,2007,5,3.0,8,10,96,"Nothing special","After reading all of the good reviews, I'm pretty disappointed with this product.  I don't think it is necessarily any better than any of the other ingrown hair products I've tried (eg. Bump Patrol) and its more expensive.  It is soothing to the skin (no burning) and has a nice scent, which is nice compared to other products but I don't think it warrants the increased cost.  It also hasn't helped to fade the dark spots from past ingrown hairs (which others had mentioned).  I think I would recommend sticking with one of the cheaper alternatives."
B000B6VIPY,2010,11,4.0,3,3,168,"Pretty Surprising","I was wary about trying another product that would supposedly solve my ingrown hair problems especially with the cost and the seemingly small amount you get.		I use an epilator so I really needed something that would help with my ingrown hairs, I was surprised that after 2 days of usage I noticed a difference. It seems to help make deep ingrown hairs visible but it does a better job at preventing and making your skin feel a bit softer. I already got rid of a couple of ingrown hairs that had been hanging out under my skin for a couple of weeks which made me really happy.		I would recommend this product because even though you don't seem to get a lot it's worth not having to deal with ingrown hairs and if you only use it once a day it seems just as good. Also it doesn't really smell.		Cons: It takes a couple of seconds to dry after application but that's really not that bad."
B000B6VIPY,2010,1,5.0,3,3,94,"Better then Tend Skin!","At first when I bought this product I thought that it wouldn't work, another over expensive thing. I have had ingrown hairs for years, anytime I shave or do anything to remove the hair, and it's not just a couple its many, tons of them. I recently bought tend skin and that only helped a little bit!		This product Princereigns worked exactly as described! I shaved then applied the gel to my legs, and not one ingrown hair!! The dark spots I do have are slowly disappearing, takes time though. This product works perfectly!"
B000B6VIPY,2009,2,1.0,3,3,43,"Did not work for me at all","I had high hopes based on other reviews.  But it has not made my ingrown hairs better at all, and actually makes me break out.  I've been trying this for 2 months now but I give up.  This is going in the garbage."

The rack has been perfectly stable and it is easy to get jars in and out. My existing jars are a bit fatter and shorter and even wrapped in paper they fit just fine.		When I bought the unit I really didn't pay attention to the labels. I really don't care about stickers. However, I must say that I very much enjoyed the nice labels that were packaged with the rack. So much so that I even applied the correct stickers to jars I already had. I haven't had any issue with the stickers coming up, but I have only had them about a week. I will update later if the labels come up.		For those who are concerned about having your spices exposed, it's easy enough to wrap some paper around the jars.

Looks great, easy to mount on wall, easy to fill, functional, etc. However, two things to note:		1. One of the 12 bottles is warped. It's slightly oval shaped, so it won't fit into the rack's hole. Let's see how miserable it is to get them to send one replacement bottle (as I didn't realize this flaw until I was done filling all of the other bottles and have zero desire to empty, repack, replace and ship back the entire item). Wish me luck.		2. The labels are not meticulously printed, so some are a little off center. Not a big deal for the average person, but I have an OCD sister in law for whom this would be maddening. Just a heads up."

B000KFUEG0,2009,1,4.0,14,15,94,"Choose your own spices","I like this spice rack because it was the only contemporary-looking one I could find that let me fill my own spice jars with my own spices.  Comes with labels for all the common spices you can think of  - just choose the 12 you use all the time that you'd like to have on your countertop.  Also comes with blank labels.  It looks really nice on my countertop and takes up hardly any room.  One downside - it's really dry in my place and some stickers didn't stick, so I just glued 'em."
B000KFUEG0,2011,1,4.0,8,8,154,"Good product","Quick adequate shipping. I was excited to get this product since I have two full shelves of spices in my cabinets and my old rotating spice rack took up too much space and didnt match our decor. The lids fit well. the labels look nice. and they have extras you can write on in case they dont provide the label (for instance, I was surprised they did not have a label for Garlic Powder :) Anyway, overall, I think I will be satisfied with this spice rack.	Con: The only con would be that the bottels are a little smaller than I would prefer. The quantity of spice that is in a standard bottle/jar purchased at the store will not fit into these jars so you end up having to store the original bottle you purchased anyway.	In the end, it is very pleasing design and seems to be functional for it's intended purposes."
B000KFUEG0,2004,1,4.0,14,17,145,"You can have everything but salt","The Prodyne Metalla 12 Bottle Spice Rack is truly an exceptional spice rack.  Stylish and yet simple, incorporating stainless steel which has become quite popular for kitchen appliances and accessories.  The black lids are a nice touch, as white too often yellows when exposed to the heat and light in a kitchen and I appreciate the choice of mounting options--it can stand on a counter, be mounted on a wall or cabinet, and stacked.  I only puchased mine a few weeks ago, so we'll see how well it holds up.  My only complaint with the rack is the pre-printed spice labels, which do not contain &quot;salt&quot;.  There is &quot;celery salt&quot;, &quot;garlic salt&quot;, &quot;onion salt&quot;, and &quot;seasoned salt&quot;, but not plain old table salt.  I found this listing while searching for an company website to see if they offered additional labels, but no luck so far."

One caveat: you cannot get anything larger than a standard half teaspoon measuring spoon into the bottle (the teaspoon ALMOST fits, but not quite). Otherwise it is an ideal solution for me; I can keep all of my spices (I bought two sets of this rack) mounted on the wall right where I prepare meals. I think this is a better solution than the ""on-the-countertop-carousel"" type spice racks."

I love the fact that I choose what spices are in them and not getting the pre-filled with ones I wouldn't use.  It is a well built unit, goes well with my other stainless steel.  I did have to make some of my own labels that were off the beaten spice path.  The bottles will hold a fair amount of spice. I did find that the holes in the shakers were larger in some cases than I wanted, but some of my shakers that came on my spice jars fit these so I switched.  The spice racks came in perfect condition.  Everyone that comes in my kitchen oohs and ahhs at them!  I think I need to purchase more for my daughters so that mine don't walk off!"

B000KFUEG0,2011,8,5.0,1,1,315,"Attractive and functional","I have 3 of these mounted on the wall under the cabinets. Attractive and handy and it clears up a couple of shelves in my cupboard. I didn't realize how colorful spices are until I put them in these clear glass jars without all those labels hiding them.		The unit is very heavy duty so I hung them up with spring open toggle bolt drywall fasteners instead of the kind that swells into the hole that are included. I also bought the Spice Jar Premium Waterproof Circular Labels in silver with black lettering for the lids so the lid tops match the brushed steel. The lids screw on tight and you can even use the plastic shakers and lids from the Spice Islands jars if you like. I fastened mine to the wall just above the counter backsplash which gives me enough room to use the top of the spice racks as a shelf to store my liquids and oddball stuff (vanilla, orange, peppermint extracts, salt & pepper mills, etc).		The only downside I know of with these jars is that they're a touch smaller than the spice jars from the store. I can fit about 80-85% of a Spice Islands container and 85-90% of a McCormick Gourmet Collection container in the jars so be prepared to keep a box stuffed in the back of a lower cabinet with your original spice bottles. I pull them out once in a while to top off my jars.		All in all a very good, well built product that doesn't clutter up the counter top. It has rubber feet on the bottom if you want to leave it on the counter but with a coffee maker, crock pot, toaster, cream & sugar containers and glass cutting board already on the counters I wanted something I could hang on the wall to save what counter top I have left."

One of the nicest features of this rack is the fact that you can either stand it up or hang it and you can stack one on top of another.

We have not mounted this, but leave it on the top of the counter; it is solid enough to stand alone without fear of toppling. Our only concern was with the stickers provided; many of hte spices that we keep were not among the options of the provided pre-printed stickers, and we didn't want to ruin consistency of the stickers by using some pre-printed and some with our (bad) handwriting.

Then I saw the stainless steel M912 spice rack on Amazon.com and ordered one. I was disappointed when the rack arrived and one of the glass spice jars was broke! I had to mail the whole thing back; but Amazon has sending returns down to a science! In a week I received a new spice rack and I was in business. The rack was easy to install on the wall and looks great. The plastic lids on the glass jars seemed at first to be a little cheap, but work fine. You are also supplied with pre-printed labels for the jars so that you can customize what spices you want to put in the rack, which is really a plus. My only complaint is that it would be nice if there was a rack that held 4-6 more jars, as 12 doesn't hold all of my spices and I don't have room for two racks, which would be more space than I would need. Other than this one minor issue, the rack is working out great and now I can actually find the tumeric and coriander when I need it."

We now have a library of spices in simple, modern jars. It's surprisingly hard to find modern spice jars that are actually functional, but these are the real deal.		The one thing you have to look out for is that these jars are a little smaller than you might be used to. Also, expect it to take a little while to transfer all of your spices neatly into these jars. While you're at it, pick up a spice funnel or two to make the job a bit easier.		The one thing I'd change is the inner lids. They're cheap, and don't &#34;snap&#34; onto the jars so much as sit on the top of them. When we transfered our spices to these jars I re-used the inner lids from the old jars and can't be happier.

I am ordering a second one because I love the way that it looks and I want to keep all my herbs and spices uniform and on display!  The standing design with small counter or cabinet footprint is a key positive feature.  I'm not nuts for the modern look but it's smart and I took the advice of another reviewer and wrote my spice names in silver sharpie for a personal touch rather than using the labels.  Each of the twelve jars has a shaker top with the large holes.  They do have a few that you can swap out for fine holes.  Some of my spices I prefer to pinch anyway.

I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I'm just not happy. The first time I used it, I was surprised it had tiny tiny beads. I figured it was because it is a ""gentle"" scrub, so I was okay with that...except it didn't expholiate my skin at all. I sat there for a good 5 minutes, and it really didn't do much at all.		I've kept using it, because sometimes products just take time for you to see a difference, but I haven't seen any good changes in my skin. The opposite actually.		I definitely needs to be paired with a facial cleanser. But I have noticed that I have had 2 pimples, that keep flairing up, while using this product. Usually a pimple will come, be ugly for a few days, then go away. For some reason, if you have a pimple and use this scrub, it might go away for a few days, but then it comes back, and will feel like a brand new pimple. I'm completely confused as to whats going on with that. BUT, overall, I'm just disappointed."

For the past two months, I have had various break outs on my face. Since high school I used Clean & Clear Daily Pore Cleanser which worked well, but the store did not have any in stock the day I went to buy some. So I decided to try Aveeno Skin Brightening Daily Scrub. It's a bit more expensive, but it was all there was.	I have been using it for two weeks now daily and several nights a week before bed. I first rub it in using small circular motions with the pads of my fingers, all around my face. Then I go back over gently with a warm wash cloth, then rinse. I love the beads because they really help with exfoliating the dead skin/dirt. With this routine, I have noticed a significant difference in the feel of my skin after I wash it. I have combination/sensitive skin (oily in t-zone then dry). Most of the bumps are gone and my face FEELS clean. Not oily or with residue like with some soaps. Hopefully in a months time, my skin will be back to ""normal"". Hope this review helps someone!"

I started to use this scrub daily evening after i go home form work - by this time my face becomes oily, shiny and a little itchy with my acne. Once I scrub it, feels fresh and this scrub did help me reduce and control acne. Even when i had no acne, I did like this scrub - good to use a scrub every once in a while to get those dead skin cells out of ur skin, right? The microbeads in it are not too big or too scrubby, i guess that is the reason it is a daily scrub. I use soap in the morning, this scrub in the evening and I am done. I rarely go for a facial kind of thing, I only put on facepacks at home once in a while, so this helps keeping my pores clean."

I just wanted a gentle scrub that cleans my face, and this Aveeno scrub is exactly it.  I love aveeno products because it feels very natural and leaves me feeling the same way.  The pros about this product is that it is a great daily scrub, it doesn't really have a strong odor, and 5 ounces actually last you a while if you use the correct amount.  Though I really do love aveeno products, there are a few cons.  It doesn't leave my face very dry, but dry enough to want to put on a little moisturizer on my face.  The beads in the scrub are also very small.  It is great for taking off daily accumulated dirt, but it doesn't exfoliate the skin as much as I want to.  I have to scrub a bit harder in problematic areas to feel like i cleaned the area well enough.  Another warning, like some reviewers already mentioned.. DO NOT GET THE BEADS IN YOUR EYE.  It actually tore my contacts once because I was trying to rub the bead out.		I would recommend this product for every day use, and use something stronger or a mud mask once a week to get the more difficult things off.  If you have a bigger issue with acne, I would not recommend this. I think it would be too gentle to use, and the scrub is too fine to clean out everything."

I use this in conjunction with the Positively Radiant Cleanser and have been extremely happy.  I have very oily and sensitive skin - believe me, I've tried just about every product out there and this is the best I've found."
B0000632EN,2008,2,2.0,18,21,705,"Not For Everyone","I like the Aveeno products I've tried, including this one. However, considering the reasons I purchased this product, I would have to say I'm disappointed with it. This product is generally not working for me.		First of all, some others here mention the smaller beads. That might seem like a small concern. However, I think the beads are the reason this product won't work for everyone--I believe that this product is mainly for those with sensitive skin, and that's what they should advertise so the rest of us can save our money. I can see how big/harsh beads can irritate some people's skin, and I've seen reviews of this product where many people have mentioned a scrub by St. Ives as an example of a harsh scrub. However, unless you have that problem of most scrubs irritating your skin, the seemingly non-existent beads in this product are just not going to get the job done on your skin...or maybe it will, but it will take a long time.		Second, this product claims to do some things I don't think it does, or maybe--again--it only does it for those with sensitive skin. For example, I have not seen my skin ""brighten"" so much as look shiny/oily in certain spots, particularly my forehead. Another thing is I do have uneven skin tone and texture, and it is not doing a thing for that. The product also doesn't really lather that well (unless maybe your face is soaked?), so I, personally, have to keep squeezing more out and wetting my face to get enough on as you need to rub this scrub in pretty good and for a while.		Third, I assumed that a product that would exfoliate the skin would also help with acne and have been led to believe by some reviews I've seen that it HAS helped some people with acne. In fact, the reason I bought this product in the first place is that my mother has it and suggested it for my skin. I used hers at her house a few times and liked the way it made my skin feel, so I decided to buy one of my own. At its price, now I'm kind of sorry I did. My acne is just the same as ever--pimples/scars did not fade one bit with this product--and, in fact, every time after using this product the same spot on my chin has become inflamed, i.e. itching/stinging sensation that just would not go away (this would go on for hours) and a raised spot, kind of like a small swelling. The last time I used this product, I applied it to my forehead and cheeks only and my chin did not become inflamed. Aside from that slight inflammation, it's as if the product does nothing but moisturizes my face, not exfoliate it.		I give the product two stars because I did like how it made my skin feel in general, especially right after using it. If I want to moisturize my skin, I will definitely use it. But I've already moved on to another product to try and treat my acne and help with skin tone/texture, Clean & Clear Oxygenating Scrub. I've been using this for a very short amount of time, but I can already note some key differences--bigger beads, a much nicer feel after using it (definitely feels amazing and like it's working), some of my pimples feel like they are shrinking within an hour of usage, skin feels INCREDIBLY soft (even my hands), don't have to use much to rub it on your face and feel it working, etc. I think this Clean & Clear scrub is going to be what I was looking for and might recommend this to people who need a stronger scrub than Aveeno's but a scrub that's not TOO strong (this C&C scrub says it's good for daily use just as Aveeno's does), but I will write a separate review under that product after I've used it more and can report more reliably. As for this Aveeno scrub, I have the foam cleanser and I'm not sure I can tell the difference between the foam cleanser and this scrub. If you have one, don't buy the other..."
B0000632EN,2005,10,5.0,10,11,87,"One of my favorites","I've used this scrub for about 2 years. Each time it lasts me about 6 months, b/c it takes such a small amount to do the job. My skin feels smoother and does in fact look brighter after use. The beads are very small which I prefer. I have somewhat sensitive, combination skin and this is one of few products I've tried that really works with that. I even feel safe letting my toddler daughter use a little dab when she wants to be just like mommy."
B0000632EN,2010,11,5.0,4,4,208,"It works for acne scars","I have dark skin and tons of acne marks-mostly hyperpigmentation, and a little bit of acne that was on its way out of my life but kept holding on. I started using this product and finished the whole bottle. I don't really care too much for face washes and stuff, and my acne was gone and so were most of my scars so I never got around to buying a new one. My acne is BACK! and with that a whole new round of scars. I didnt really think at that time that this product was actually improving my skin and got rid of my acne, instead i just chalked it up to my hormone problems being fixed and the scars fading by themselves. The other day I was thinking why i started getting acne again, and then came to the conclusion that i stopped using this product so I am definitely adding this product to my daily regimen.	So, I can say that it did actually fade my scars overtime. It also helped my acne although I'm not sure if it is really meant for that. It was just a bonus for me. I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin like me."
B0000632EN,2006,3,5.0,4,4,307,"A great cleanser!","I have used various cleansers for my sensitive face.		So far I have tried Neutrogena, Clean & Clear, Cetaphil, Purpose, and etc products.		Because my skin had some problems with Salicylic Acid, I ended up using Cetaphil instead of other acne-treatment cleansers.		In my opinion, Cetaphil and Purpose were great because they did not cause any irritation on my face.		The only problem that I had with Cetaphil was that whenever I applied the soap on my face, I did not feel anything.		To some people, this was a good thing.		However, not to me; I wanted to feel something when I put some soaps on my face.		Since I had heard many great things about Aveeno, (my dertmatologist and pharmacist recommended their products along with Lubiderm's), I gave it a try.		I purchased Aveeno moisturing lotion, sun block, and this cleanser at the same time.		When I apply small amount of this scrub on my and rub it, I could sense that the cleaner has some rich ingredients in it.		After leaving the cleanser on my face for few minutes and washed it away, I could feel that my face was moisturized...		Yes, I like the soap very much.		From now on, I will only use the Aveeno products because they are cheap (compared to other products sold at the mall) and they work great.		Although I hope that the beads in the scrubs were a little bit more larger, this cleaner still does what it claims to do, without any flaws.		Try it and be happy. like myself ;)		PS: Does my face look more brightening after using this product?  I don't know...  Since I don't have that light-face, I cannot say whether this product has a lightening effect or not.  But even without the effect, this cleanser is still a great product to use!"

Granted, SH is the last ingredient but I can't help but think that using this product over time could be a cancer or skin damage risk. I'll just copy and paste what I found on a website called truthinaging...	""Sodium Hydroxide is, however, a known irritant. Studies by the National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health found that this ingredient causes ""Irritation eyes, skin, mucous membrane; pneumonitis; eye, skin burns; temporary loss of hair"" and recommends that consumers prevent skin and eye contact. The CDC reports that ""Skin contact with sodium hydroxide can cause severe burns with deep ulcerations. Pain and irritation are evident within 3 minutes, but contact with dilute solutions may not cause symptoms for several hours. Contact with the eye may produce pain and irritation, and in severe cases, clouding of the eye and blindness."" Solutions as weak as .12% have shown to destruct healthy skin cells within one hour. Other studies acknowledge Sodium Hydroxide as a strong irritant that is corrosive to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, but that the severity of the effects are related directly to concentration and pH levels, as well as the length of exposure and skin type.""

Before this I wasn't using any soap on my face, I just never really had any problems with acne.  This product has been pretty good, it does what it says it does.  It has made my skin shiny in a good way.  The main reason I got it was to exfoliate my skin and as a simple wash for sweat and dirt.  I was skeptical at first because when I was younger I use to use other face washes that were too rough.  This product does dry my skin a little after a wash, but the body uses its own oils to counteract that dryness and makes that dryness feel fade after 20 minutes.  It does help to get rid of any blemishes on the skin, I had few, but the few I have (had) are pretty much gone now.  The reviews on this product are somewhat funny.  The negative reviews say that it doesn't help their acne.  I can't say if it does or doesn't but one must remember it isn't all about the soap, it's the body also being in chemical balance.  Everything in moderation goes a long way with the body in helping remain chemically balanced.  This is a great product though, the small beads are nice and definitely clean well.  For example, I work outside during the day and after a 9 hour shift outside I had dirt and electrical tape residue on my fingers.  I used my regular body wash to clean off the tape residue, still left black marks.  When I applied the scrub to my hands and fingers, off went the residue.

Their version is $2-$3 cheaper, smells THE SAME, and almost the same texture (the scrub is slightly bigger). It cleans the same and pretty much IS the same product.		I love the Aveeno product but only buy it when it's on sale. Otherwise it's the Target Brand. I really hate when companies find a lovely product and then just price it higher because they know people love the product so much, they'll spend the money. Why should consumers have to pay for that? It makes no sense! If more people are buying the product, it should be CHEAPER than more expensive."

I've discovered benzoyl peroxide works wonders and found a few really good products, but this one beats them all by far and is MUCH cheaper.  I've read that this dries many people out, but it doesn't dry me out and my skin is not that oily.  I guess if it dries you out, a good, lightweight oil-free moisturizer could handle it.

This is a little on the high side, but it does have the max percentage of medicine you can buy OTC, and it really does control bad breakouts.

So after recently checking every store (Walgreens, Walmart, CVS, RiteAid, Dollar General, etc.) I have come to the conclusion they are no longer selling the item.  So I was on the hunt for something that had a comparable amount of Benzoyl Peroxide and I came across ClearZit.	I started using it this past week and I have extremely oily skin. At first I didn't notice any changes, and it was causing any flaking and it didn't really feel like a medication, but today, in my 4th or 5th day of using it, it has broken through my oily skin and I see that it is FINALLY working for me.  I have used so many products and this is a trial period for this one, because I had initially bough Ambi to fade my hyperpigmentation from the acne scars that I have on my face.  This seems to be doing the trick.  I also have been using Witch Hazel as an astringent/toner for my face and using Aveeno facial cleansing pads with Salicylc Acid to wash my face.  So far so good.  My pimples are drying out (I had to stop putting around my eye, becuase of the thin skin and the bit of irritation)and my acne scars seem to be lightening up. I also use a sunscreen moisturizer from Aveeno with 30 SPF during the day.

My skin pretty much stayed cleared but recently, I had to switch birth control pills which made me have some minor breakouts.  It wasn't really bad, but enough to annoy me.  Pimples started popping up, a new one every other day.  My mom suggested seeing my dermatologist. But really, who feels like forking up 40 bucks on the copayment to get an anti-biotic and cream that takes so long to kick in.  So, I went to Walmart and saw on that bottom shelf that they had one PanOxl Bar left for 8 bucks.  I've been able to find this at CVS and Walgreens as well.  After using it twice a day for the last three days, the minor breakouts have disappeared and the blemishes are fading.  My skin looks absolutely amazing, I just had to write a review. I highly recommend this product and definitely make sure that you wear a moisturizer/sunscreen.

Well, I went to the dermatologist and they recommended this product so i tried it out. the first week or so i do admit your face does bring up a few pimples and impurities, but it gets soooo much better right after!! If your on the edge just at least try it. You wont regret it. I trust no other product than panoxyl. TRY IT!"
B0000Y3COC,2012,5,2.0,1,1,384,"Worth trying out!","UPDATE: I liked the product so much I wanted to purchase more PanOxyl. However, when I checked the price I was shocked. On June 2, 2012 I bought PanOxyl for $8. Now it's $20?? I contacted the seller about the increase about the price. I stated that I found PanOxyl at Costco/BJs for $7, and asked Armando (the seller) if he could match the price. He said ""No, but thanks for the heads up."" He seemed rude, and cocky. Not buying from this seller ever again. Edited my review from 4 stars to 2 for the rudeness.		I'm 22 years old, and I've never really had a problem with acne until now. I've tried OTC products including OXY and Stridex with no success. Perhaps it was the kind of makeup I was using, or the change in the weather, or the fact that since I'm getting older, my body chemistry is changing. Either way, I was having a problem (massive red bumps, regular pimples, white heads, etc.)		I browsed through Amazon looking for something. I came across PanOxyl and thought I'd give it a try. I admit, I was a little concerned about how concentrated the formula is (10%) but I figured ""Why not?""		I read the reviews to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into.		Yes it can dry out your skin, depending on your skin type. I have oily skin--using this twice a day for several days I noticed patches of skin were rough. I simply cut down how often I used the soap.		Yes it will bleach your towels. This I was not happy with. However, I dye my towels so it's more of a hassle. In the future I would have a towel designated for the use of this soap (this isn't a problem if you use it in the shower, just if you wash your face at the sink.)		All in all, this stuff works. And it lasts quite a long time since it is in bar form. If you're sick of spending money on OTC products, and are tired of using harsh smelling products, this is your next step. I would seriously recommend this product if you're having acne problems. It's only $8, and it's in bar form so it will last quite a while."

I have been using for 8 days (once a day) on my under arms (not using it on my face, dont really need it) and other sensitive places prone to acne. I am so proud to say two days in I was getting relief! Plus it hasn't bothered my sensitive skin! I have used everything on these bumps over the years from drawing salve (black tar like dream that literally draws out the infection) to having to take antibiotics when they got bad.  I do as the box says and try to leave it sitting on the skin for a few minutes. So far I am over whelmed with relief and joy, I wont be embarrassed to wear sleeveless shirts this summer!!		As a side note I also use seabreeze (well the knock off brand) on my skin as well to help stop any bumps from forming. If all I have to do is use this soap and sea breeze I will be happy.

Be sure to use this ONLY at night for the first few days until you figure out how much it dries out your skin. I found using a facial complexion brush encourages one to really massage and cleanse the skin and pores for the recommended 2 minutes. OK I admit I used to be a splish-splash kind of face washer until a friend reminded me how long doctors take washing their hands to get rid of germs/bacteria OR how long you're supposed to brush your teeth. IF it doesn't dry you out too much you can use it twice a day. IF too drying then use it every other day. My athletic teenager's back-ne has responded better to this than liquid Benzoyl Peroxide washes, gels, ointments. Be sure to use sunscreen while using this product to protect your new, sensitive skin.		My family has used PanOxyl Acne Cleansing Bar off and on for years on Pharmacist's recommendation BEFORE Benzoyl Peroxide was deemed the acne cure-all in nearly ALL acne preparations. We have used both the 5% and 10% BOTH are now very difficult to find, I stocked up when 5-6 bucks a bar. I can remember paying less than 2 bucks a bar at local drug stores when it still was in the red, white and blue box.

My acne is clearing up and now I only use the PanOxyl bar along with my alcohol-free toner and Neutragena moisturizer to help with dryness. If I get too dry sometimes due to weather changes or washing my face too much, I switch to my Cetaphil gentle cleanser. Some people give up using this soap due to dryness, but you should just pay attention to your skin's needs by cutting back to once a day or every other day and you should still use a moisturizer along with it and DRINK WATER!!! And dry your face with a white towel or you will have bleach spots all over your pretty new colorful towels, like me.

I was skeptical because it was cheaper than anything I had ever purchased to treat my Acne(which never worked out for me).		Well, one wash and my face had that tight feeling, which I personally like, and was drying out my skin's pimples, the next day my pimples were gone!!!	I started using it everyday and my skin was getting better and better it was knocking out those pimples like Bruce Lee.		I haven't used this in a while because, I only get a couple pimples every now and then when I am stressed out mainly. Only downside is, it kills the Acne on the surface, and you need to combine this with an oral medicine/antibiotic to completely rid youself of Acne. I still have acne scars (which I will need a chemical peel to get rid of) and acne, which I am going to see a dermatologist about again for a more effective oral treatment than the usual tectracycline they like to prescibed on a dime.

From tiny red bumps to ones with white heads and itchy ones and painful to touch ones. I've been so self conscious and it does take a toll on your emotions especially feeling like you've tried everything and nothing really works. I've tried going to my doctor and she just gave me ointments and antibiotics (that I didn't take) one of the ointment was a benzoyl peroxide and after using it I noticed it did clear out a bit but it felt like my face looks bloated in the morning after putting it on at night. I got scared so I stopped using it. I figured I could be allergic to benzoyl. Then I broke out again so I went out and tried clean and clear. The ones that comes in a set sort of like proactive. Didn't work. Then I tried proactive. Didn't work. Then I tried doing the apple cider vinegar and it still didn't work. After reading up some more of the ACV, someone mentioned Panoxyl and how they heard Dr Oz mention it too. So I thought ok let's look for it. Found it at CVS for 8$ and I've been using it twice a day (am and pm) and I know this is probably just in my head but I swear to you, after using it just for one day, I woke up thinking damn my pimples are actually disappearing! Like the big ones are actually smaller and doesn't look like it's about to explode. The tiny ones on my forehead are now just tiny dark marks and the white head ones are gone and are now just kinda dark reds. It did dry out my skin around the mouth area and I'm still trying to find a good moisturizer to help with that. I'm also scared of using moisturizers because I do have oily skin so I'm afraid of it blocking out my pores and making more pimples. So if anyone can recommend a good one for oily skin that would help. It hasn't been a week yet so right now my skin is just looking a bit better but the acne scars are still there and I still do feel like i still need some makeup to cover it.

I have tried every acne product out there, including ProActiv, and nothing works as good as this soap (especially in conjunction with my acne prescriptions!) I use the PanOxl soap every day, as my dermatologist recommended.  My daughter also uses this soap (and nothing else) to treat her teenage acne.  It clears her up within a day or two - every time!		The bar comes in a plastic tray with a lid, so you can keep it dry in the shower. One bar lasts me several months, with daily use.

B0000Y3COC,2012,5,1.0,3,3,267,"Can't Explain It.","I picked up the PanOxyl 10% Bar when I couldn't find the Foaming Wash at my local Wal-Mart which usually has the Foaming Wash of the same type, which I am still an enormous fan of, at a reasonable price. The bar was $4 cheaper as well so I figured hey, same thing but in a bar, why not right?		Well, for reasons that I cannot explain, my acne has never flared up so badly with a Benzoyl Peroxide medication. I can't remember the last time I had so many zits on my forehead and cheeks. The kind of zits that are stubborn too, they returned over and over again. I am under the impression that the medication's tendency to dry the skin accelerated oil production. Even using a good lotion after application made no difference. Maybe there was something wrong in my routine I don't know.		Taking a look at the ingredients the two are different. Not my much, but they are different. Perhaps my skin just disliked something in the bar. Either way, I cannot rate this product very highly for what it did to my face. I have since switched back to the PanOxyl Foaming Face Wash of the same grade and my skin has started clearing up again within a matter of a few days which makes me think something about the bar, whatever it was, just didn't get along with my skin. I am sure this bar will work miracles for most, but those of you who have some more sensitive skin like mine, try the Face Wash instead, it works wonderfully."

I bought mine at Walgreens, but I'm a regular customer on Amazon and wanted to give this an updated review. I read the reviews on this product on Walgreens' website, but even on that website it had almost full stars. I have fair skin and it's rather sensitive so I started off only using this product once a day followed by a really good FACIAL moisturizer and within the first week, I noticed a HUGE improvement! I only use this product maybe once every two weeks now and I've noticed I rarely even get any zits at all. I was even able to change from a coverup foundation to just a tinted moisturizer with vitamins in it! It can dry your face out, it started to dry mine out so I started to wash my face with it once every three days to where now, I don't even really need it! Best product for acne for the price- and I should know, I have everything from clean & clear to neutrogena in my bathroom but this product beats all of them by far and it was priced at around $8."

I found this bar mentioned on an acne forum and decided to give it a try. 1 word- AMAZING!		My body acne cleared up almost instantly! I couldn't believe it was so simple! I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone suffering from body acne.		A side note: DO NOT use on your face.

B0000Y3COC,2009,8,5.0,3,3,254,Amazing!!!!!!,"I was suffering from a bad case of cystic acne on my upper lip and chin area. I tried many acne medications and treatments that were unsuccessful in getting rid of my acne; however, PanOxyl was amazing! From my experience, Benzoyl Peroxide works much better than the drying Salicylic Acid. It seemed to do a better job of penetrating into the deeper layers of the skin. After one day I noticed the redness go down. After three days the pimples started to shrink. Now, after using the soap for a week, all I have left are dried bumps where the acne used to be. I now need to find something that can make the acne scars/discoloration go away. I hope my skin doesnt get used to the soap.		Here is some advice though: use a good toner and moisturizer after you wash your face because the soap IS drying. The box says to wash your face for a good 1 to 2 minute with the soap, but that seems like a long time in reality, so its hard to follow through. Plus, my hands feel dry afterwards. Again, use a good moisturizer for your face. I use Thayers lavendar+witch hazel toner. As for moisturizers I alternate between Seacret Face Serum in the mornings and Clinique Moisture Surge in the evenings.		As for the package, it wasnt packed very well. The distributer placed the box of soap in a bubble envelope. The soap box was damaged during delivery, but luckily the soap itself survived. ^_^"

I used a colored washcloth and it did bleach the washcloth but it healed my skin in 2 days. I still get a few pimples here and there but Im so impressed.

When that happens, those little red monsters start invading your facial space again.  What is so great about the bar is that it is really EASY to use it every day.  For people with horrible acne (like me)it is really important to be consistent.  Just washing the face with it a couple minutes in the shower does wonders.

In a panic, you rush home and check the web to find out what the heck is going on as your acne is raging by the minute.  You read a few links and run into the fateful moment - Stiefel decided not to make the product any longer  (lack of demand, chemical contents, updated packaging/formula, etc. etc.)  Ok, calm down, don't panic. It has to be out there somewhere. I will find it. Weeks go by, you rack up hundreds of miles on your speedometer, countless hours spent search from store to store to store to no avail.		You throw in the towel, you give up. But, in a last chance effort, you remembered  that you did see it for sale on Amazon.com for an outrageous price you swore you would never pay.  You thought to yourself ""Man, what a rip off!""  ""They are raping customers!""  ""Talk about taking advantage of a situation!"" ""This should be banned/regulated"" etc. etc.		Now, understanding all the tremendous effort, hours, travel, miles, money, sanity, cost of item (not to forget a substantial Amazon selling percentage fee & packing materials, too)  etc. etc. that go into simply locating this product,  you graciously place the Panoxyl Bar in your Amazon.com shopping cart with a sigh of relief.

It cleared my skin, and haven't had problems again until about 2 months ago. I started breaking out with tons of tiny bumps on my forehead, sides of face, neck, behind my ears and my chest. My skin was really oily. I stopped using certain hair products and makeup to see if that was causing it, but the bumps stayed and got worse no matter what I tried. I decided to go to the dermatologist to see what he thought, and he barely listened to me and prescribed an antibiotic and expensive face cream. I really didn't want to take an antibiotic so I researched online and came across this bar of soap. I bought it for less than $10 at Walgreens 6 days ago. I have been washing my face, neck and chest once a day. After the first two nights, I noticed that the bumps on my chest where gone. By day 6 (today), my face and neck are incredibly smoother with only a few bumps remaining (which you can barely see). I can't believe how well and fast this soap worked! It's incredible! I haven't experienced any over drying of my skin either. I know it hasn't even been a week since I started this product so if anything changes I will come back and update my review, but so far this stuff is WONDERFUL!!! Give it a try!"
B0000Y3COC,2011,11,5.0,2,2,84,"Love this stuff!","I was initially prescribed this by my dermatologist at the VA. When I asked to have it refilled, I was told they no longer offered it and she thinks it had something to do with the manufacturer possibly no longer making it. I just happened to check online and there seems to be no shortage. I bought several (just in case). This soap is great and I use it daily on my face. It doesn't dry my skin out and it is very effective."
B0000Y3COC,2011,9,5.0,2,2,194,"Best Soap to Clear Up Oil/Acne on the Face","PanOxl bar used to be available locally, but my drug store stopped carrying it.  So I am very glad I found it on amazon.  There are two varieties a 5% and a 10%.  For me, I usually use the 10% during the warmer months of the year, and the 5% during dry/cold winter months because the PanOxl soap does have a drying effect.		This product works better for me than any other acne/face soap that I have ever used. It lathers well, apply to face, and rinse clean. The medication in the soap is great at clearing up blemishes, and better yet, prevents break-outs.		I tend to have oily skin on my face, but using PanOxl soap in the morning and at night prevents my face from becoming shiney.		The soap comes in a little plastic soap dish with a clear lid, so it is clean and self-contained.		I recommend this soap to anyone who has oily skin or acne breakouts. If you tend to have dry skin on your face, you may want to try the 5% first.  I have used it for years. Glad to see that it is carried on amazon."
B0000Y3COC,2009,11,4.0,2,2,86,"Great results fast butit  does dry out","My dermatologist recommended the bar.  I've moved to the wash and mainly use it at night unless there's a breakout.  It is easy to use too  much.  I get dried out and dark around mouth chin.  So I use a vitamin E capsule which immediately soothes. Hopefully I will figure out how to use this without over drying my face.  I rarely break out now though unless overdried.  This greatly reduced my breakouts. I'm African American so it's hard to find something sensitive enough yet effective."
B0000Y3COC,2009,9,5.0,2,2,115,"Finally something affordable to get rid of body acne","I've had acne on my back and butt on and off pretty much from 13 to 21 at present (which is NOT fun when bathing suit season comes around). I recently tried a salicylic acid body wash, but after 3 months and using the entire bottle I saw no results. After one week of using the PanOxyl bar I already see the acne fading quite a bit. My dermatologist gave me a prescription awhile ago for a benzoyl peroxide cream, but even with my insurance I couldn't afford it, so this is quite the money saver. I'm also very excited to see that a grocery store close to me has just started to stock this."
B0000Y3COC,2012,11,3.0,1,1,21,"Over Priced","good product, but too expensive. not to knock the product, but the people selling these items are charging way to much."
B00027DMI8,2006,1,3.0,151,190,221,"To ROC or not...","Don't think about using this if you have very dry skin, as the retinol which eases those fine lines also causes skin to flake and peel, and Never use any product not especially designed for the orbital area around your eyes. I had undergone laser resurfacing about nine years ago on my face, but at the time my doctor said the forehead didn't need it. Now it doesn't have the same smooth feel as the rest of the skin on my face, so I decided to try the ROC Over-night Deep Wrinkle cream. Been using it for several weeks, and it has lessened the lines and made my skin feel smoother, but I've had to use some heavy-duty moisturizer during the day to counteract the drying effects of the product. I've now stopped using it and am using Kinerase, which smooths out those lines but also moisturizes as well. Don't expect it to work overnight, it has a cumulative effect, but at least while you're using it, it hydrates the skin better than anything I've found yet, and it was recommended to me by the surgeon who did the lasering on my face. As far as the ROC product, I would recommend it for short-term use only, and not for those with dry skin issues, as it will only aggravate them."
B00027DMI8,2007,3,4.0,54,66,315,"Don't mean to sound corny - but it REALLY does keep it's PROMISES!","I am a 52 year old female (will be 53 next week) who, for the past year has  been distressed about my undereye area. I have huge hazel eyes which have always been one of my best features-  the change you undergo with aging is not that drastic - but you begin to look  tired. I finally decided to try something, and I have to say - the fact that this product has been around for awhile (I personally don't know anyone who uses it) AND THE PRICE (because of course it won't make any difference) made me pick this one from Eckerds. I have been using it for 9 days and I swear it is working! My undereye area is actually improving! This is especially noticable when my face is fully made up - I wonder how they will look after a couple of months of continuous use. I have even decided to try the cream for my face, although I really am not concerned about it yet - I figure it can't hurt- this product actually seems to improve the quality of your skin. I notice in the reviews that one customer had a problem with dryness - I am the exact opposite -  my skin has always been extremely oily and I am going through menopause as well- (night sweats and day sweats too) I have NEVER been able to wear ANY kind of moisturizer- it caused me to break out with pimples! I am even thinking of getting my 76 year old mom (a former beauty queen) both of these products to try! I would definately recommend the eye cream! This is the first time I have ever written a review for this website - I really believe in this product! The company's catch phrase ""we keep our promises"" is dead on the money as far as this reviewer is concerned!!!!!!"
B00027DMI8,2006,7,5.0,46,56,35,"This stuff really works!!!!","I'm sixty years old and I have been using this product for years. When I had my yearly physical the Doc ask me if I used anything because my skin looks so good. RoC delivers!!!!"
B00027DMI8,2009,4,5.0,18,20,97,"Worked great ...for me.","I had virtually no skin care routine, up until recently I was a wash and go kind of girl. Howevever, I noticed signs of aging and after dropping a few pounds I felt I looked worse.  So I started researching and this product came up alot.  I saw drastic difference in one week.  My skin cleared and it looked younger.  This may be attributed to the fact that I was starting at ground zero, but I definitely see great results.  I am experimenting with other products, but I will keep this one on my must have list."
B00027DMI8,2006,0,5.0,97,122,119,"Really works amazingly well","I must say that I was skeptical about this, but for the low price versus department store cosmetics, figured it was worth a try.  Amazingly, it really works quite well and MY WIFE LOVES IT!		After a few weeks, people were commenting that she looked less tired, asked if she had lost weight, been exercising or on vacation.  Since it works gradually over a few weeks, you notice a bit of difference yourself, but the people who don't see you that often really notice a dramatic change.  Smaller wrinkles are smoothed out and disappear completely, while large ones get smaller.		It won't make a 69 year old look 20, but definitely takes off a decade of wear and tear."
B00027DMI8,2010,1,1.0,86,108,486,"Proceed with Caution","I've read the reviews, with people raving about this product, so I'm sure it works for most people.  However, this is definitely one product you need to be careful with.  Test it over a weekend because if you are allergic, you are going to need the time to recover from it.  My mom bought it first and after a few weeks of use, she'd had the tingling and some redness that the product says are normal until your skin adjusts.  She didn't think anything about the cream until one day when she realized she was having a severe reaction to it.  Her face swelled up like a balloon, and you could barely see her eyes.  She took Benedryl in large doses to stop the reaction, and it took her about a week to look normal.  She did not get it near her eyes.  Her pharmacist said they are seeing lots of people with reactions to skin creams lately, so perhaps there is a new chemical that products are using.  Your reaction will depend on your individual tolerances, and there's no other way to know unless you try it.		Since my mom is allergic to many things, and I am generally not, she gave the cream to me to try.  For two nights, I tried it on a small portion of skin on my chin, and I had no problems. On Friday night, I put it on my forehead, chin, and below the cheekbones, to test it on a larger area away from the eyes.  Wow, was my reaction different!  Saturday, my eyes were red and felt a bit warm, and they watered a lot. By that night, I didn't apply it again because my tongue and lips tingled, along with my hands, and I knew it was a reaction to the cream.  By midnight Saturday, 28 hours since I'd first applied it in a larger area, I was also getting out the Benedryl to stop the burning feeling.  I'm writing this about 6pm Sunday, and I still feel tingling in my face and hands and tongue, my face feels tender and warm, and the skin on my eyelids and under my eyes is bright red.  Believe me, I didn't get it anywhere near my eyes and I washed my hands after applying it.		It is a shame some of us react this way, and there are some people who will say we didn't apply it right, or test it properly. I know that in my case, that isn't true. I'm not sure what is in it that would cause this kind of severe reaction, but it is up to you to try it for yourselves.  I'm not criticizing the product with my rating, but by rating it low, people might read a warning that could help them.  As I told my mom, when our faces were swollen up, they are right - we have no wrinkles!"
B00027DMI8,2011,1,5.0,9,9,74,"My ""11s"" are now a ""1""","I've have tried everything from Neutrogena to Frownies for the ""11"" frown lines between my eyebrows... (everything short of botox) and after only about a week one of the lines was so dramatically reduced that I could see a difference in photos!	I didn't experience any drying or flaking and my skin feels very soft after applying... I will definitely continue to use Roc products and buy them from Amazon instead of paying retail!"
B00027DMI8,2009,2,1.0,24,29,42,"Highly scented with perfume!","The night time wrinkle cream is highly scented with perfume and causes eyes to water and sneezing.  why is it necessary for a night cream to contain perfume!? If you have sensitive skin or sensitive to perfumes do not buy this product."
B00027DMI8,2010,4,4.0,8,8,184,"It works, but be careful...","First off, I have to say, the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream has actually made an improvement in the appearance of my wrinkles in the month or so I have been using it. I don't have a lot of really deep wrinkles, but the ones near my mouth have definitely been reduced. I'm very impressed how the cream has done on the fine parchment-y wrinkles on my forehead. That part is awesome.		This stuff does make your skin more sensitive. They warn on the package that the cream will sting at first, and yes, it did. Your skin gets used to the active ingredients, and it stops stinging eventually. However, my skin is a bit sensitive to touch. Maybe this will go away after a few more months. I also feel more sensitive in the sun, as they warn you. The ""gee, I better get out of the sun"" feeling comes on very quickly. Also, the eye area is a little too sensitive for this cream, so if that's your main wrinkle concern, you need to get another product for that area."
B00027DMI8,2009,2,5.0,7,7,19,shooequeen,"I like this product it seems to work very well, better than others I have used. Will buy again"
B00027DMI8,2012,11,5.0,2,2,433,"Wonderful results, works as described","The most important thing to know before buying this is that retinol is a serious chemical. Its skin clearing properties were first discovered over 80 years ago but it used to require a doctor's prescription. Why? Because like I said, it's serious stuff. ;)		The version that's available in this tube isn't nearly as potent as what the pharmacy has. But it gets the job done. Retinol is one of the only chemicals that truly can reduce wrinkles.		Most products can only claim to reduce ""the appearance"" of wrinkles. They work only by plumping up skin to make it look more flat and also hydrating it so lines aren't so obvious. But as soon as you stop using it, the wrinkles will return.		Retinol actually can reduce wrinkles, and countless studies have confirmed it. But all great things come at a price. The downside of this miracle is that you'll turn into a vampire!		Retinol makes the skin extremely sensitive to the sun. Some people experience burning after only being in the sun 15 mins. while using retinol. So once you start using this, you'll have to be much more conscious of your skin.		Retinol is also pretty harsh. You may experience painful burning, redness, and itching after you start using this. It isn't RoC's fault, so don't get upset at them. It's the nature of retinol and the price you pay for youth. Once you adjust, you'll probably be fine unless your skin is too sensitive. If so, I think RoC offers a sensitive skin formula too, so I'd recommend that.		Now that I've thoroughly terrified you, let me tell you the good news--- It works! I've been wearing it nightly for 30 days now and I already see subtle changes in my wrinkles. It takes 12 weeks to really see a difference but most people should see some kind of results within the first 4 weeks. The box mentions 4, 8, 12 weeks so it's a gradual cycle of improvement.		12 weeks probably sounds like a long time to most people, especially if you want instant results. But retinol is not a fly-by-night, gimmicky product. It's the real deal and it takes time to penetrate the layers of skin on your face and start working its magic. Give it time, be patient, and start out cautiously! I recommend a thin layer on a small patch of skin first, just in case you have a bad reaction to it.		Good luck, and thanks to RoC for making one of the most readily available retinol products that you can buy without a prescription!"
B00027DMI8,2012,8,4.0,2,2,136,"Best so far ... but not perfect","I am probably looking for perfect which I do not think is out there .. I am 62 years of age and where my skin isn't terrible .. I probably am looking for my skin to be of a 40 year old which is NOT going to happen .. I know it looks younger than I am .. just want miracles I think .. however, it has improved it .. just not as much as I wish it would .. now, again .. it is good enough tha I am NOT going to change at this time and have already ordered a 2nd tube ... they are good products .. I recommended them to my 70 yr old sister as well as my almost 40 year old daughter .. they both are using them as well."
B00027DMI8,2012,7,4.0,2,2,139,"Decent product that works well.","I don't tend to spend a lot of money on face creams or lotions, so to me it was a little expensive, although it seems the price has gone down on Amazon since I purchased this item. Overall I think it worked well on my wrinkles, I am not sure that I noticed a huge difference on the lines around my eyes, but it definitely worked to get rid of a deep line between my eyebrows. You do have to use it regularly, especially at first, but I have cut back to a few times a week and the deep line is still barely visible. The smell is OK to me, not too overwhelming, but there is a tingling sensation when I first put the cream on. I would recommend this to someone to reduce the appearance of wrinkles."

I purchased this product end of Feb/12 and started using in March.  After applying every night for 2 months I saw no noticeable difference but upon researching I realized I wasn't using enough (Roc says only a pea size amount?)of the product for it to really work.		After using the proper amount for six weeks I do see a striking difference!  Lady's this really delivers as it says!  If you find during usage your skin is reacting to the retinol, apply a very good moisturizer over it but let the retinol sink in for a good 15-20 mins first before moisturizing...this is the key in allowing the cream to do its job.  Another is to exfoliate your skin properly 1-2X per week for maximum absorption.		My skin is now glowing and blemish-free...no white bumps just the occasional pimple.  My skin was showing that ""crepe paper"" look before around the parenthesis lines and forehead and I tell you it has diminished  considerably.  My pores have improved dramatically...smaller and not clogged with sebum.		I will definitely repurchase this product from Amazon as they continue to offer it at an affordable price!"
B00027DMI8,2012,4,5.0,2,2,262,"This is really good stuff, it works, and go Vegan","I put this on subscription/save, it is much lower than in retail.  I use it every night, it takes several weeks to see a visible difference, but you will.  I recommend micro dermabrasion to clear skin and allow better absortion.  I can tell a big difference, my skin is much clearer, and smooher.  This is a very good product, and amazon offers it so those of us on a budget can afford it.  Add a good diet rich in vegetables,, exercise, sunscreen, plenty of water and you are on your way to younger lookig skin.  I am 63.  I have always used a skin product since my teens.  I live in the desert so it is very important to keep the skin nourished.  I have always been told, I appear much, much younger than I am.  The key is, diet, exercise, attitude, and skin care.  Go for it.		As as added bonus, I went Vegan.  30 days now.  With a Vegan diet, the first thing you will notice while using this product is a reduction in red patches, and oiliness of the skin.  You will see a glow to the skin.  Smoother.  I had breakouts on my nose area, sorta pimply things with white puss, yuck, since I went Vegan I don't have these any longer.  So using this product along with the Vegan diet you will see a marvelous transformation.  People at work have taken notice, making comments like, you look younger, you look great, etc.  Nice for the ego.  I say go for it, it is easier than you think."
B00027DMI8,2012,4,5.0,2,2,108,"Great Stuff!","As with the eye cream, I didn't want an expensive script for retinol so chose RoC after a lot of research.  I use it every evening along with a daily and weekly skin care routine.  I DID notice a big difference in a week's time, as did everybody else. After about a month it was easily 10 or so years knocked off my appearance!  I got the sensitive the first time because usually I have to be careful with skin care products, but had zero negative reaction to the retinol.

The only thing I notice is that the eye cream burns a bit when I first apply it, which is a bit disconcerting.  But there is no redness and the stinging goes away quickly.  I plan to continue using the creams for a full 12 weeks, as they recommend, to see if I can notice a difference.  But so far, I see nothing, feel nothing.  Anyone else experience this?  Am I rushing things too much?  I do use sunscreen when I got out on my bike, etc., even though the day cream has sunscreen in it.  I have not noticed any dryness as other people have, but I do apply another moisturizer at night, as they recommend.  For me, the jury is still out.

I didn't read on the label where it was harmful for the eye area, and that's the area I was most interested in improving. I won't be using this product anymore as the area around my eyes looks far worse than it ever did before. Maybe the actual eye cream works."

B00027DMI8,2010,6,5.0,9,10,318,"IT WORKS FOR ME!","As the years start piling on, I have tried many creams to help my skin appear younger and also to be healthier.  I am a occasional smoker, which I know does awful things to my skin.  I finally tried RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream.  I immediately felt it working on my skin with its slight burning sensation, which I deduced was sloughing off the dead, wrinkly skin.  Note:  the burning sensation only lasts about a minute or two on me.		I knew I might have a winner at that point.  So, instead of continuing to waste money on products that I felt were not working, I used my old moisturizing cream on one side of my face and RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream on the other side of my face for 3 months. Yes, THREE MONTHS, to make sure I really knew if I had a product that worked.		On Easter of this year, I attended the usual family gathering, and I asked my friends and family if they could see less defined wrinkles on one side of my face versus the other.  Almost everyone chose the side with the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream as the side with lesser wrinkles.  (The two who didn't select that side were not wearing their glasses and I surmise that they were just guessing, like it was a guessing game.)		I have been using it every day since, and on both sides of my face.  IT REALLY WORKS WELL FOR ME!  It is not a miracle cream, and no creams are!  However, I and everyone I know really did see results of less defined wrinkles!		P.S.  The Roc Retinol day cream with the 30 SPF does not feel like it works as well, and the burning sensation is not as intense, so I am guessing that it is not as potent at this night cream."
B00027DMI8,2010,7,5.0,6,6,152,"My new night cream!","I've been using this cream for some time now and I can attest that it works!  I'm approaching 60 so I have my share of wrinkles.  The area I'm particularly impressed with is the chest area.  I don't go in the sun a lot because I'm very fair skinned, but over the years I've been to my share of soccer & baseball games with my sons.  I always had make-up on at games that had SPF protection so my face has faired better.  But the exposed chest area has noticeably wrinkled over the years.  It's hardly noticeable anymore since I've been using Roc.  I had been using an expensive department store brand (which also worked well), but for about 1/10 the cost, I'll stay with Roc.  I have not used it around the eye area as some have mentioned.  I wouldn't even consider that.  There are other products for the eye area."
B00027DMI8,2010,0,5.0,6,6,167,"Definite Improvement. I love this product!","I can see a definite improvement after using the Deep Wrinkle Night Cream. In fact, my favorite RoC products are the night creams, and I've probably tried most night creams available. I get better results from using it than when I plopped down hundreds of dollars for department-store brands.		I still use expensive brand-named foundations, but this cream has my face smoother and I have a brighter complexion. The dark circles under my eyes are better, much diminished, but not gone yet. I think I'll see continued improvement over time. I don't expect perfection until there is a total cure for allergies, of course.		You really do have to protect your skin from sunlight, because it will be more sensitive when you use anything with Retinol. I like RoC products more than most. The tubes seem small, but you don't use much and it seem to last for me and I'm not very careful with it. Someone who is careful could make it last a L-O-N-G time."
B00027DMI8,2010,8,4.0,14,17,246,"Worth it--Great product","First I would like to address the one star reviews related to irritation, sensitivity, allergic reactions, etc. It is a shame these one star reviews exist because it is bringing the overall rating of the product down while the comments of these reviewers have nothing to do with the product itself, but rather the retinol in the product. If you research retinol, you will see that almost anyone's skin will react negatively at first. It takes a few days/week to acclimate your face to it. And the fact that your skin is reacting is a good sign that the retinol is doing its job.		Any retinol product says that you should start out by applying every other or every third night. And then apply nightly. Well, I didn't follow that advice and by night 4 my face was a little sensitive, chapped feeling and dry. Then some peeling areas for a couple days and actually looked worse. But now i am in week 2 and my face is acclimated to the retinol and it is now busy doing what it is supposed to do--reduce the fine lines and repair sun damage.		I would have given 5 stars, but I need a little more time before I can see the real results. But medical research proves that retinol does improve the appearance of fine lines and does repair damage to some degree--so I feel confident the product will at least improve my crow's feet and discoloration somewhat."

CONS: After using it for only 1 night, my skin got really red and itchy. It felt like I had a sunburn on my face and neck. I used a tiny tiny amount, so you can imagine how strong this product is. It is supposed to leave the skin soft, smooth, and younger-looking...not true. My mom also tried this, and the same result....she said it was not for her either.

I waited to review this until I had used it for 12 weeks, so I would have a good idea what I thought about it.  I took before pictures of myself when I started and compared myself to them.  The verdict:  I do not look 10 years younger like it said I would.  I might notice a 5% improvement or that just might be me hoping the wrinkles have improved that much.	The positives are that the tube lasted me a long time, and I do not mind the scent at all.  I know some people have said they do not like it.  I did experience some redness about 4 weeks into using it, but that went away.  I was hoping that meant it was taking some of the wrinkles with it, but that didn't happen.  So, in the end, it wasn't the miracle cream I was hoping it would be."

Plus, for years I've heard ""don't waste your $$$ on that expensive stuff, the cheap stuff works just as good!""		I recently quit smoking, and decided with the $120/month I'm now saving to go ahead and splurge and see for myself if that advice was correct. Well, maybe for those particular women it was. But for me, I already started noticing the results on the third morning. This is morning 8, and everyone else is noticing too. Comments like ""you look so refreshed!"", or ""you look really nice...did you do something different with your hair?"" etc.		It's not just the wrinkles that are fading, but my face seems to be returning to that overall youthful glow I once had.

I am truly amazed! In two weeks it took care of everything, seriously. I am only 30 so the areas were very minor but it is still amazing. Even better, I have had a pretty nasty spider bite scar on my neck for the past few years that always drives me crazy because it is very noticeable (very red and large, it looks like a giant pimple at all times), it has shrunk and is not red anymore at all. I could not be happier about this, I have tried so many creams to try to make the scar less noticeable. All in all, I love this cream!"

I had rough patches here and there, plus oily T-zone and this cream was great on my entire face.  No breakouts and the texture of my skin is fantastic now. Concealer and make up go on a lot smoother now. The ONE thing I hate about this product is the heavy perfume smell which is completely unneccessary, but I finally got use to it. I wish ROC would lessen the fragrance or take it out altogether. But I've tried expensive dept. store brands and this one works just as good and great price.

The only thing she said is to make sure you never go out in the sun with this on your face because of the retinol.  Anyway, I started using it and I have to say I really like it.

Years ago, when I first started using it, I had some sensitivity but now no negative reactions at all.		I use other products in conjuction with ROC but if I could only use one, ROC would be it.  I have strong, medium tone oily skin and at 54, need something for fine lines, dullness, age spots, and wrinkles.  This does the trick with a least one daily use but often I use it twice a day.  If I use it for the day, I use a sunscreen over it.  I can even use it around my eyes but usually use a vitamin K cream for under eye dark circles and puffiness.		I wear lipstick and no foundation or other make up and always get compliments on my skin.  If I switch to another cream, in time the effects of the ROC wear off.

I've been using this for about a week.		I think it may be because I have younger skin and this is really rich, or it's drawing out impurities, but I am breaking out a little bit all over. BUT. This is making my deep scar more and more shallow every time I use it. I have actually been using this during the day because it's so light and actually makes for a nice makeup primer. It does make my skin pretty dry, but nothing that moisturizer and exfoliation can't help.

Peter Thomas Roth did okay but not near as good as this. Not all things work for every person, but this works for me and at this price, I would try this before the others.		One more thing though, it does have quite a perfume to it, so much so that the first two times I put it on I ended up washing it off and was quite upset.

I was careful not to put it too close to my eyes like others had mentioned. My cheeks and forehead were revived, but I still felt like my eyes were suffering. So many prescription creams carried the hefty price tag, so I turned to more suggestions online and landed on a different but inexpensive retinol cream to try for the circles and creases I'd developed around the eyes.

Since washing my face that much earlier doesn't always happen, I have ended up using this about every other night.	I also use an old pillowcase laid over my nice pillowcase just in case it should stain.	When I wait for my skin to be completely dry, I get NO flaking or scaliness the next day.		The first couple of months I was also using the product sparingly but now I slather it on. 2 months ago, I started using it with the eye cream.		In the day, I use Olay regenerating serum (slathered on), Aveeno 30 sunblock and my foundation which doesn't have much sunscreen in it.		My skin is now the best it has ever been. The mottled sunscreen damage is almost all gone, though not totally, and I can see my original freckles for the first time in years.	 No pimples or cysts- the product dries them up almost over night before they are visible. I can still feel them form under the skin, however, it's not my age that has rid me of acne yet but the Roc dissolving them.		I also had a small skin tag appear under my eyebrow- it was gone in 2 days with a careful application of this product- not the eye cream.		My wrinkles, while slight, seem much less pronounced and overall, my skin is tight, even and glowing. I am using much less makeup than ever to achieve the same look."

I didnt really have alot of wrinkles, but decided to start using as a preventative product. I used to think you could only get rid of wrinkles by using prescription products. After using this for a few weeks my faint lines on my forehead were completly gone. I dont even use this product every night! I maybe use it 3 or 4 nights a week. I even went to the derm a few weeks ago for something else and he made a remark about my forehead looking like a 20 yr olds!	Now, I really did only have faint lines before, but it really is smooth now. I also always use sunscreen and my make-up has spf 15 in it. I also use a good moisturizer during the day so my face doesnt get dry."

This product has parabens","I searched the internet before buying this product and couldn't find anything stating that this product contains parabens but I should have known since the ingredients list was not shown. Anyway, I got the package today and of course, it contains methylparaben and propylparaben. Parabens are synthetic preservatives used in cosmetics and personal care products, The danger lies in the fact that our bodies readily absorb parabens and studies show that parabens are hormone disruptors affecting our endocrine system by mimickng estrogen (in both men and women). Excess estrogen as you  may know has the potential to cause breast cancer. Lesson learned. I will not buy any more products without seeing the ingredients label. Amazon, you could improve by being more transparent for your customers."
B00027DMI8,2011,2,5.0,30,33,469,"OMGosh! ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!","I started using the L'Oreal Advanced RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle Concentrate about six months ago because of my deep, long smile lines (hey, don't hate me because I smile a lot!) and my very deep forehead lines (I'm a mother, I worry a lot!). Although none of those lines got worse, neither did they diminish. About 2-1/2 months ago, I started using the Olay ProX Exfoliating Cleanser, Olay ProX Skin Tightening Serum, and Olay ProX Age Repair Lotion. The Olay ProX products have done a good, but not great, job so I decided I needed to try something else for the deep-set lines. Therefore, I started my usual Amazon.com search for products and their reviews. I came upon the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream and, despite some of the reviews stating some scary results (burning, peeling, rashes, etc., etc., etc.), I decided to try it. I was very apprehensive because I have extremely sensitive skin, but I threw caution to the wind and ordered it anyway. AND I AM SO GLAD I DID! I ordered it very late in the evening on March 7th, it shipped on March 8th, and in the afternoon of March 10th I received it. I applied it that night and last night. I did not expect to see any kind of results any time soon because of how long I used the L'Oreal Advanced RevitaLift product without much change. I usually give a skin product at least one month before writing a review in order to give the product enough time to do its ""thing."" Well, I woke up this morning and, before I started my daily morning facial regimen, I noticed a marked reduction in all the lines on my forehead and the smile line on the left side of my mouth; these are no long deep-set lines. However, the smile line of the right side of my mouth is another story; IT'S ALMOST GONE!!! I'm amazed, shocked, elated, ecstatic, etc.! I purchased this on the Amazon.com subscription plan, so it was not even $10 (extremely less than any other store's price). I used such a little bit of the product and it's done in two nights what the L'Oreal product couldn't and didn't do in six months! As I stated above, I have extremely sensitive skin and was extremely fearful I would experience one, some, or all of the adverse reactions others have stated in their reviews. But, hallelujah, I have had no burning, tingling, sensitivity, blotches, redness, rash, etc. whatsoever, NONE, NOT A ONE! Thank you, RoC, for a product that actually does what it claims and for not charging an arm and a leg for it!!! I highly recommend this product and will be ordering another one right now so I will not run out! You should do the same."

Here is there number should you have more questions however: 1-800-782-1964.	 The Lot # on the box reads like this:  0639V  A	This means the product was made on the 63rd day of 2009 (March 4th). I was told that there are no expirations on cremes with an unlimited shelf life such as this Night Creme.  Other cremes such as the ones with sunscreen have a shelf life with expiration dates.  Cremes can go rancid, and stop being effective. Always smell product, and make sure you yourself do not contaminate products with unclean hands or leaving caps off near sinks etc.	  There was a 10 minute wait to get to a RoC phone Representative but he was very helpful with my questions."

I decided to try this as it wasn't too expensive (look at Strivectin - ouch!) and thought even a small improvement would be worth the price.  I have to say, I'm shocked.  After about two weeks, I saw noticeable changes, and it's now been about 6 weeks, and the improvement has been tremendous.  The wrinkles on my forehead are almost gone.  I'll definitely be purchasing more.		Like some of the other reviews, there are areas this shouldn't go, like around the eyes.  Be careful about that, as it created a little redness, not bad, but it really dried out my skin and caused flaking, which too about a week to clear up.  Again, no problems anywhere else, but in sensitive areas like the eyes, it's potency was obvious, and these areas couldn't take it."

B00027DMI8,2012,0,5.0,3,3,311,"So Good I Went to Work Today Without Makeup On for The First Time in 15 yrs.","I've always laughed at the way moisturizers are marketed as having scientific-sounding properties with ""visible results"" so when I bought this, I was really only expecting a nice facial cream from a reputable company at a cheap price.  I started using it 10 days ago and as expected, it seemed like a decent moisturizer but otherwise unremarkable.  I completely forgot about the promise of ""visible results"" never having really expected them due to the low price. Then, about three days ago, I went to put on my makeup before work and stopped because it looked like I already had. I had to actually wipe a tissue over my face to reassure myself that no, I wasn't losing my mind--it was my bare skin.  I can't believe it but after only a matter of days, my face looks like it did 15 years ago when I was 36.  Back then, I had great skin and could get away with using a bare minimum amount of liquid makeup.  As I got older, though, I had to use more and more to the point that by the time I was 50, I wouldn't be caught dead in public without makeup on.  Today, I went to work without makeup for the first time in 15 yrs.  Even my husband, who thinks beauty products are a scam and a waste of money, commented about it and he NEVER notices anything--not hair coloring or styling, new nails, pedicures, facials and professional makeup--nothing.  This stuff is AMAZING.  Add the price to the equation and it's really the best beauty product I think I have ever purchased.  I read the review cautioning to not apply it around the eyes. That was not my experience. For the first week, the only place I applied it was around my eyes.  Now I use it on my whole face. I am SOLD."
B00027DMI8,2011,8,1.0,3,3,221,"The First Time!!","This is the first time my skin has ever had a reaction to skincare. The only thing I love about my skin is that it never seem to react to anything I subject it to & I have no allergies when it comes to skincare. Now I can only say, most skincare. I love the ROC Wrinkle filler & bought it before trying this cream. The most sickening thing about this cream is that it gave me a break out which is rare. I now have 4 pimples which are rather red & yet, I don't see any results. I felt a slight sting when I put the cream on, near the cheek & mouth area.		I usually sort of wipe off remainder cream on my neck after applying it to my face & now, parts of my neck is rather red & itchy. UGLY!! Again I shall say, this is the first time this has happened so this cream is a very special cream indeed! On a lighter note, I bought the eye cream of the same range & it was fine. I don't see really visible results but it was easy to smooth on & comfortable to the eyelids. I'll review that one when I have more time. I shall still to the ROC Wrinkle Filler from now on."
B00027DMI8,2011,4,5.0,3,3,37,"Smells really good.","I don't have wrinkles yet because I'm 20, but the retinol in it is also good for acne. I have fewer breakouts and smoother skin after using it a couple times a week for a few weeks."
B00027DMI8,2010,10,4.0,3,3,165,Amazing,"Amazing! This could be the best drugstore skin care product I have used. I have combination skin and always have mild-to-moderate sun spot issue on my cheeks....other than that, I have pretty great skin and happy with it. I purchased this product as I started to notice fine wrinkles around my lips, and decided to try a Retinol product. The texture of the product is a lightweight cream and it is absorbed so quickly when you apply it. I used it for a good solid week, and was shocked by the result. Not only did it diminish all the fine lines, it also improve my overall complexion and my skin is much brighter.		The only downside is that you need to slather a thick layer of sunscreen EVERYDAY when you use this product as it makes your skin sensitive to sun exposure. I think winter is the best time to use a Retinol product and I will def repurchase when I run out of it."
B00027DMI8,2011,9,1.0,5,6,36,"didn't like it","Bought ROC retinol products after running out of retin a.  This does not do the same as retin a.  I couldn't stand the perfume smell.  It made me break out.  Going back to using retin a."

For me, the most noticable results were the lines on my forehead. I'm 43, so I don't think they are going away with anything OTC or without surgery, but I really could tell a difference. I did have a little sensativity around my eyes, but I would just not apply the product there for a day or two and I was fine! The cream has a great feel, texture and smell also!"
B00027DMI8,2009,5,2.0,5,6,148,"Smooth feeling creme but causes breakouts!!","I couldn't use this product more than a week because it filled my face with acne. I get random small pimples once or twice a month (even more around that time of the month) but this lotion made three pimples appear in my face by day 4. I wasn't 100% sure if it was the lotion so I continued using it. At the end of the week I had around seven pimples all over my face. My face was not flattering from any angle! I stopped using it right away and my face went back to normal in two weeks. Not ready to throw away all my money, I decided a few weeks later to try this on my boyfriend and see what happen. He noticed the same breakout problem without me saying anything about the lotion. I definitely wouldn't recommend this for anyone who's prone to acne."
B00027DMI8,2009,2,3.0,5,6,111,"RoC Retinol - Ehh...","I tried this product as an anti-ager.  Haven't used it long enough to see much difference, altho retinols are supposed to -- over time -- help build collagen.  It is non-irritating, but my problem with it is the base in which the active ingredients are carried.  It is a pretty dry base and it does not spread very well.  In order to get enough of the product to cover your face, you end up using quite a bit each time.  This makes the product ultimately more expensive than others.  Next time I will probably go with the Neutrogena retinol product, unless I find this one at a really good sale price."

It is so overpowering it marks hair, clothes, sheets, furniture, the whole area you inhabit. If you have a husband/partner who is sensitive to scent, better think about this. I can not bear using it, so much perfume on the face gives me an almost instant headache. Some people will like or not mind the smell, but I really hate it. It screams ""old fashioned, little-old-lady wearing too much bad perfume""! And of course, if you are wearing a perfume you like, this will overpower and ruin it. Why not make a face cream unscented? This product is ridiculous!"
B00027DMI8,2012,8,5.0,1,1,151,"Great for Acne","I bought this product to help with my acne and acne scars I have along my jaw.  I have tried a lot of topical acne products over the decades and very few of them gave me any effect.  In fact more than a few of them that were supposed to be non-comodogenic gave more more pimples due to clogging my pores.  I have been using this product for only about a week and I have noticed that the scars along my jaw seem less raised, and fewer whiteheads and blackheads on my chin.  We'll see how it stacks up over time.  I have cystic acne and have been using DIM orally for my acne in conjunction with this product.  The DIM has taken my acne down about a power of ten so that I do not get those big angry bumps, but the RoC retinol cream seems to really be helping."

Thought it was time to possibly get rid of the few wrinkles that were appearing.  I used the ROC Correxion cream and not much was happening.  However, after 3 weeks, my face began to itch and then I noticed deep lines throughout my face.  It became a nightmare.  The deep wrinkles that appeared looked awful.  I immediately stopped using the product.  How could this ever be reversed was my concern.  I used nothing on my face until the itching stopped (about one week.)  Then I slathered my usual Olay moisturizer, and after two months, my skin is back to normal. My experience is not the norm, but just beware if you have sensitive skin."

I just finished using my first tube, lasted about 3 months of once daily use all over my face and neck, and there is a very noticeable difference in my skin.  I do not have a lot of wrinkles, but am showing signs of aging and what this product has done is firm up my skin.  I can tell just by touching my face my skin is firmer.  For the few wrinkles I do have, they are much less apparent.  I do use this around my eyes, below and on the eyelids, and yes, it does sometimes make my eyes water a little, but that goes away.  What I really like is how it has firmed up my eyelids.  As you get older, you start to get excess skin on your eyelids that can give you a ""just woke up"" look.  Using the ROC cream, it has firmed up my eyelids - not completely - but they look much less droopy.	Now, no OTC anti-wrinkle cream will make you look 10 years younger (not yet anyway), so don't expect miracles, but it does firm up your skin, diminish real wrinkles (notice I did not say fine lines), and gives you a more youthful appearance.  The only thing I don't like is the sweet smell of the product.  It is not bad, but they could have skipped that.  Not needed.	Definitely recommend this ROC product and it is very inexpensive compared to many OTC anti-wrinkle products.  (BTW - I tried Kinerase too, and it did nothing).

After a month of use I notice some modest improvement, the ultra light expression lines are almost invisible but the medium ones are still visible but slightly less pronounced, I didn't take before and after pictures of myself so this is based purely on memory.

After reading the reviews, I was worried about irritation, stinging, redness, and peeling with the Roc. I'm happy to report that I have not had those problems and I think others might avoid issues if they ensure that their skin is completely (seriously, completely) dry before application. I noticed this when in a rush one night--I smeared some on slightly wet skin and had a slight burning/stinging feeling instantly--something that has never happened when my skin was completely dry.		As far as making me look younger, I don't think I've used it long enough to report on effectiveness yet."

I've avoided sun since age 45 after two basal cells removed.  I'm 70, not overweight, and exercise (indoors).  Eventually I started getting small wrinkles on my cheeks and corners of eyes plus dark circles.  Two months ago I started RoC Deep Wrinkle Night Cream and Eye cream at night plus moisturizer and Deep Wrinkle serum during the day with moisturizer.

Constant breakout was followed by  sun damage, acne and scratch scars all over the face, then wrinkles were getting deeper. Discovering regimen including Genes cream helped out a lot. I bought this tube because of good reviews from Amazon. Wrinkles smoothed out first, then tone changed. After eight weeks, I noticed  the area of scars and size of pores were diminishing. After using Roc for nine weeks, I compared pictures of my face at two years ago(at age 38) and before Roc usage. There was simply no comparison. My skin tone is so much lighter that I had to change the whole makeup and wrinkles are much less noticeable.		After 12 weeks of use: This product increased sun sensitivity to such a level that my skin was almost seared in January sun.This happened under SPF 60 sunblock and thick layer of Clinique even better foundation and almost powder.12 weeks of work all disappeared. I stopped using it and went back to Genes cream regimen."

I'm 25 and African with no wrinkling or fine lines but I wanted to start using the product for preventative measures. I have really oily skin with large pores and within 2 weeks of using the product it drastically shrank the size of my pores and my face was more radiant, softer and more even toned. Exactly what I was looking for! I did not have any serious reactions to the product, my skin is dryer but nothing to complain about considering how oily it was previously.

The packaging states that you may experience redness or tingling until your skin adapts tot he cream. For the first 2 days, I didn't feel anything, and I never applied the cream near my eyes (even though some well-known magazines and websites indicate that you can do this with this particular product), but I did apply it up to my cheekbones. On day 4, I woke up with a burning sensation so strong, I couldn't even touch my cheekbones without wincing in pain. I ran for the bathroom and discovered a shiny, red, super-sensitive area that reminds me of the feeling after being burned. Turns out, I WAS actually burned! I'm not sure why or how or whether I got a faulty product, but the cream had caused a moderate chemical burn. My doctor could only guess that it was because my skin tends to be dry and more sensitive in the dry winter time.		Needless to say, I never went back to the product, threw the rest of it away, and immediately told everyone to avoid it. Maybe this would work for someone with really thick, leathery skin, but I'll never buy this brand again. This was a truly painful experience that has made me paranoid to trust any ""anti-wrinkle"" cream again. Wrinkles may be unsightly, but at least they don't cause injury."

I have not used any anti-aging creams before, but I did research very thoroughly which product was most effective and still reasonably priced. This one was the winner, and the results prove that my research paid off. I have been using this product on my forehead for the past few weeks and the changes have been amazing! (Originally I used it on my entire face, but I have VERY sensitive skin and found the cream too harsh for the rest of my face leaving an itchy rash.) Even from the first time I used it I could tell there was an improvement in the texture and appearance of my skin.  I would recommend this cream to anyone. It's not too thick (I have naturally oily skin) and the odor isn't very strong (and actually rather pleasant). My skin also has fortunately not become MORE sensitive from using this product.

B00027DMI8,2012,2,5.0,3,3,369,"I like it more than I anticipated","I will start off by saying that I use the Deep Wrinkle Night Cream as part of a Roc regime that I have found to work very well.  Each morning I apply the Multi-Correxion Lift Anti-Gravity Eye Cream around the entire ocular zone and under my eyes; I apply the Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Serum on my forehead every day and a few times a week I will rub it into the area where smile lines may appear one day.		While I know its ""bad,"" I am used to sleeping in my makeup because I am semi-oily and my oily skin has treated me well post-teenage-acne.  I decided to stop this in order to wash away the environment I am exposed to (I live in a metropolitan area), and I turned to the Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream.		I'm glad I did!		Because I use this in tandem with other Roc products, I can't say this is a one-stop miracle product, BUT, after one use I immediately noticed how smooth and supple my skin felt in the morning.  I can say I had the same feeling that I had by sleeping in my own oils- very silky skin.  It does tingle so be prepared for that, at first.  I use the Retinol Correxion Eye Cream at night as well.		Using the products as a collective group has reduced the size of my enormous pores and my deep acne scars are fading away after 3-4 months of diligently using this daily regime.  My girlfriends have commented on how I am not developing lines on my forehead like they are.  I had a noticeable crease under my eyes that is now far more faint and only stretches half as long as before.		Products one can buy at Target are not going to magically fix your face overnight, but, after 3 months, I can happily say I have no crows feet, a very reduced crease under my eyes, no forehead wrinkles, very-reduced acne scars and an overall smoother complexion with a lot less redness.  I am a smoker, so, based on what I see with my other smoker friends, my skin should look differently, and, it happens to look really great."
B00027DMI8,2012,1,2.0,3,3,186,"Doesn't irritate but doesn't remove wrinkles, either","I've been using the roC Deep Correction Wrinkle Cream morning and night now for about a month.  I apply only to my forehead, between my eyebrows, to my nasolabial folds, and my neck.  I'm 40, so my wrinkles are not deep or pronounced but I definitely have them.  The pros: my skin sometimes reacts badly to skincare products, but this did not irritate at all, which is why I started applying it in the morning AND night.  The smell is pleasant, and the texture is fairly light.  The cons:  nothing is happening.  After about a month, my wrinkles and lines have not diminished or softened one bit.  I was really hoping it would work on the frown lines between my eyebrows, but there was no improvement at all.  I'm about halfway through the tube and will use up the rest.  If anything changes, I'll edit my review, but I really don't expect any results if I haven't seen any by now.	UPDATE 3-22-12 I've finished the tube, applying it both morning and night, and still NO REDUCTION in wrinkles, fine or deep.  A waste of money."
B00027DMI8,2012,2,4.0,1,2,251,"I can't believe it actually works","Since I'm starting to get to the age where I need to think about keeping the lines on my face from becoming entrenched wrinkles, I decided to start using a night cream for my face and eyes.  I did my research and found that products with retinol and other vitamin A derivatives were probably my best bet.  However, I also saw that retinol is lower strength than the Retin-A that you can get with a prescription, so I wasn't expecting much.		I've been using this cream for about 2 weeks now, and I can't believe the difference already.  My skin has such a beautiful, even skin tone (goodbye blotches!), and it's much softer and brighter than it was before.  It almost looks like it glows.  My pores are also noticeably smaller.  I'm seriously shocked.  I have had some of the flaking others have mentioned, but it's only been around my nostrils, nowhere else.  From what I have read, this is pretty normal and goes away with continued usage.  It already appears to be fading.		I have a deep-ish line across my brow and one in between my eyebrows (too much deep thinking!), and they are not really affected yet that I can tell, but like I said, it's only been two weeks.  If after 6-8 weeks they are noticeably better, I will come back, add to this review, and bump the score to 5 stars.  But as it is, I think this product is great just to improve your skin's health."

I used it for s week.  A BIG mistake!!!!!  I wish I read other people's reviews before using it.  Besides burning your skin, (and that can't be healthy) it has ADDED DEEP WRINKLES under my eyes all the way to the top of my cheeks.  I now look 70 and have to wear sunglasses to hide my eyes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't have sensitive skin either. I am hoping the aloe gel I got will help heal my skin.

I try to put the serum only on areas outside of	the eye upper and lower lid areas. If I accidentally travel some of the serum onto my eye lid area	it creates my eye lid to be like a water blister with raw areas in the eye crease.	I only apply the serum lightly so it is not that I slather it on.	If I put on an eye cream first and then the serum farther out from the eyes I do not have the problem.	There are just those mornings like today when time is short and I forget to put the serum on last so there is no	residue on my finger tips before the eye cream goes on.

B00027DMI8,2010,10,3.0,1,2,182,"Not much so far but I beat the flaky skin stage!","I am 37 and have been using for a month but have not noticed much of a difference. The skin around my eyes have slightly improved but thats it so far. I actually use twice a day and have not been affected by the dry skin stage like so many. For me the reason is because I use a face ointment (great product I have been using for years) instead of lotion. It is not heavy because my skin will be damp when applying so I have light, even coverage. This provides me with hydrated skin all day which lotion never seemed to do. I also apply the night cream on my skin when its damp so the strength is a little less intense (which is why I use 2x a day) and I can easily smooth over face, eyes, neck and chest. When my skin is dry, I have to use twice as much.		I will continue to use. Everyone is different when it comes to skincare success, and Im sure that over time I will see more results. Good luck!"
B00027DMI8,2007,3,3.0,8,13,336,"My thoughts after 2 weeks of use","I don't expect to see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes until I have used this for at least a month, so this is a prelim review which I will update over time.  This product is a retinol product, and because it is non-prescription it is not as strong as Retin A. For me that is great - I have tried prescription Retin A and it made my face hurt and peel.  This product has had some good reviews and I thought I'd give it a try for the minor eye wrinkles that show when I smile.		So far I am  happy - I use it just once per day, in the evening, after cleansing with Aqua Glycolic cleanser (see my review on that product).  I wait at least 15 minutes after rinsing off the cleanser, then apply this around my eyes and on my forehead. There is very little scent in this product and it has not clogged my pores. It has not dried my skin out but some users report problems with that.  If that starts to happen I will add a moisturizer after using it.		 I will stick with just using it at bedtime as I use Skinceuticals C E Ferulic every a.m. and would not want to add anything that might interfere with how the Skinceuticals product works on my skin (much less add another layer of a product before my foundation.)		Tonight, for the first time, I put it on my cheeks and will see how they look in the a.m. (I have rosacea so I'm very careful what products I use on my cheeks).  I just noticed that one of the ingredients in this product is glycolic acid.  That is good because dermatology journals have reported good results in treating rosacea via glycolic acid peels.  (That's why I started using the Aqua Glycolic cleanser - I wanted to see if the glycolic acid would make a difference, but did not want the expense of a dermatologist peel)."
B00027DMI8,2009,2,1.0,4,7,43,"Not Happy - burned","After using for about 10 days my face looks like it has a severe sunburn, it is extremely dried out and inflamed.  Anything I apply to ease the chemical burn only stings.  I wouldn't recommend this if your skin is fair and sensitive."

B00027DMSI,2011,0,2.0,6,7,199,"Effective but uncomfortable","When I couldn't find my favorite 'pink tape', I tried these, but there are features of the product that made me put it aside.  First of all, I was surprised to find the paper is very stiff, like old-fashioned butcher's paper.  Because the patches are rather large, I had to tear them to get pieces that were sized appropriately.  Cutting the patches to a smaller size left stiff edges and points that could still irritate.  I also didn't like having to wet the 'glue' on the patches to stick them to my face and ended up with the occasional breakout as a result of using them.  They did minimize the lines, but the resulting irritation just shifted the problem.  I ended up discontinuing use.		Luckily, I was able to find the pink tape on Amazon even though I couldn't find it any longer in stores and switched back to using it. It's much easier to use and more comfortable.  Although it's officially hair setting tape, it is effective for removing lines by smoothing the skin overnight while you sleep and it never causes breakouts. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C510OW"">3m Scotch Professional Hair Set Tape With Dispenser * Created Especially For Hair Styling</a>."

I am a ""side and face sleeper"" - I lay on my side and smash my face up all night long, and it has started to take its toll around my eyes and in between them. I use Frownies between my eyes and they stop that dreaded double line (or frown lines) between my eyes.	Some things to note if you try them, I've found Amazon to be the most economic site for the purchase, don't use too much water when applying, hold them in place for at least 30 secs - or longer, and get them really wet before trying to take them off, or you will remove a layer of your face...I mean really, really wet, the adhesive is very powerful. Think of it as having glued cardboard to your face. Would you just rip that right off?	I personally do not use them around the sides of my eyes (crows feet / smile lines). I cant imagine the skin in that area being able to handle these patches, but that's just my preference.	Frownies are perfect for those of us hanging on to the last minutes of our youth with a death grip, but unwilling (or chicken like me) to undergo any type of chemical or surgical procedure.

You have to wear them at least every night for a week to really see the difference, but well worth every penny. Enjoy your coffee and wine and wear frownies! Reasons to wear your frownies.....		Alcohol dilates small blood vessels in skin, increasing blood flow near skin's surface.  It:		  * Causes skin to look wrinkled	  * Turns skin red and flush		What You Can Do: Limit yourself to one alcoholic beverage per day.		Caffeine causes water loss from your body and skin, resulting in a lack in skin's plumpness.What You Can Do:		  * Limit caffeine to 300 milligrams per day (about 2 large cups of caffeinated coffee or 3 small)	  * Drink plenty of water	  * Green tea has less caffeine than coffee and contains antioxidants that protect against skin cancer"

Because they do the job for at least a moment, and that's good enough for me. I put them on my frown lines every night before bed (after hubby's already asleep, because they don't exactly scream ""Seduce Me, Baby"") and I rip them off every morning. Guess what? The ripping-off part causes the skin between my eyebrows to puff up and swell, and VOILA! I have no more frown lines. Best cheap Botox around, and it lasts for a few hours. Too bad it didn't last all day, but it's better than shooting botulism into one's forehead, which is a little too close to the brain for comfort (I have a theory that all those current Botox-lovers are going to be brain-damaged zombies in the future after the buildup of botulism eats away at their brain cells... but I digress). Anyway, I would heartily recommend this product if life's difficulties have gotten in the way of a frown-free face, or if you just want a temporary pick-me-where, for a moment, you look like your younger, happier self.

B00027DMSI,2012,7,5.0,2,2,95,"Forehead Frownies that Make me Smile","Although I get many chuckles from my significant other when I apply my forehead frownies at bedtime, I do have to say that I can't imagine going to bed without them.  The frownies really do seem to smooth my forehead area, or at least they are keeping the matter from getting worse.  I've even convinced one of my work friends to purchase the frownies, and she loves them too.  So until I decide to have some cosmetic surgery or injections of some sort, I'll stick with the frownies.  For the price, one can't go wrong."
B00027DMSI,2006,6,4.0,115,118,132,"Work despite skepticism","I was not convinced this product would really work, but since my friend recommended it and I thought I would try it as I was desperate. I don't find their pseudo-scientific explanation of how they work very convincing, but despite all this, I do think they help smooth out the lines between my brows. If nothing else, they at least prevent it from worsening while I'm sleeping.		The effect is somewhat temporary and gradual, but it does work. It's not as quick (or as expensive!) as Botox, but in some ways it's actually better. Botox temporarily paralyzes an area so you get kind of a weird frozen face. The Frownies will smooth the area out a bit, but still allow full movement and expression.		For the money, I think it's definitely worthwhile."
B00027DMSI,2007,1,4.0,77,79,206,"It works!","I have to disagree with a previous reviewer. This is not a hoax. And it's not really like parcel paper! Frownies work a very simple 'mechanical' way. It prevents the muscles to move just like as Botox would do. It's the same principles except it's way safer. As it is done for a limited time (night time being the best), you can't expect the dramatic results of Botox of course but you'll definitely see a difference.		I have used them for 10 years now and I have bought them over and over. But I have noticed that this is not something you can stop using. I don't really think you can 're-train' your muscles for good. If you stop, nature takes its right back and your expression lines will re-appear (same as Botox). Results will also depends on how deep the wrinkle is. I can only speak for myself here as my frown lines were slight when I started to use them.		The best thing is to give it a go and see for yourself. It's important to follow the instructions carefully (the patch must really hold tight on the skin) ie putting a patch EVERY night for at least four weeks to see obvious results."
B00027DMSI,2007,4,5.0,76,82,215,"Very Surprised","I am 27-yrs-old and have an ""As between my eyebrows"" or had. I have bought such expensive creams, ranging from drug store to high-price well reputable brands. Nothing worked. They would 'soften' the line, and that was about it! One day I typed ""line between brows"" in google and found frownies. With the low price, I gave it a go! I was excited from the reviews, but still.. did not think they would work.		I can say 3 weeks later, the line is completely vanished! I am just amazed watching the transformation everyday. Now when I look in the mirror, even in the worsst lighting, I can not see the line. It is amazing considering something so old-fasioned and cheap would work like this. I swore if they worked, I would take the time to review so others can be persuaded as well. I am still surprised, that it was this quick to see 100% results with Frownies.		Now I have been puting Frownies on a line I have on the side of my mouth, that has developed since 21. I have seen it 'soften' the line and improve it about 60%. I am still waiting to see if this will get better or not. But it definely helps the forehead wrinkle. Thank you Frownies!!"

Admittedly, my frown line is very deep and the skin is pretty damaged.  I have had the wrinkle since my 20's and I am now 40.  Botox is so expensive, though!	On the other hand, Frownies are easy to use, they're inexpensive and they have no negative side effects.  Well, other than they look a little bit silly and you have to soak them off in the shower every morning.	These are what people used to call ""Hollywood Wings"".  Stars used them before Botox.	Frownies has a good website with videos that show how to use the products."

I would much rather lick and stick a piece of stiff brown paper to my head every night than have that kind of karma on my conscious. Some people have complained that this product is something you can make yourself, seriously you have time to do that? I'm exahusted just ripping them apart on the pre-scored lines. They're not that expensive, especially if you shop around a little (sorry amazon) but jeeze if you're really that crafty and cheap i guess you could make your own...?		The stickers do take a little getting used to (especially by boyfriends) but after using them for a while I stopped taking them off in the middle of the night and now sometimes forget it's there until I look in the mirror in the morning. I wake up with a smoother forehead and though I still get lines at the end of the day, they really don't seem to be getting deeper over time. At first my boyfriend thought I looked like some kinda star trek space alien walking around with a diamond shaped piece of paper on my face but after seeing how smooth my forehead looked in the morning, he had been assimilated!"

Of course it is temporary, so it botox!  The thing I wanted to tell shoppers is I do not buy the frownies spritz  for them, I use clean tap water as it drips out of faucet.  Cheaper on Amazon than in store, in my experience. Be sure to stretch your face upward when you put them on!"
B00027DMSI,2007,4,5.0,26,29,276,"Woohoo, they seem to work!","The last couple of years have been extraordinarily stressful for me - A few weeks ago, ""worry lines"" started appearing on my face (AGH!). I searched the internet for a few hours, looking up different kinds of creams/lotions/magical goop to smooth them out... After a while, I stumbled across a review for Frownies.		Already wary with the knowledge that chemicals can cause unforseen (and unknown...) side effects after years of use, these looked like the perfect alternative - So I went ahead and gave 'em a shot.		The morning after the first night I wore these, my little beginnings-of-worry-lines were almost *entirely* gone. This effect lasted for a few hours before they started ""reappearing""; The second morning went just as well.		The 'scientific' explanation on the Frownies pamphlet that comes with the box doesn't seem quite right, lol: It seems more like an overnight training session for the muscles around the lines, creases, wrinkles... what-have-you. I've found that it's possible to look in the mirror and train yourself to hold the muscles in ""crease-free"" position long after the Frownies have done their job. (Be aware of how the skin and muscles feel after you've removed the Frownies, and when you notice yourself relaxing into your old, crease-causing facial expressions, make the minute corrections needed to smooth your expression out.)		Taking them off is easy if you take a shower in the morning - splash warm water on your face & let it sit while you shampoo your hair. They'll come off quite easily after a minute or two. :-)		They are working wonders for me so far - Best of luck to everyone trying them out!"
B00027DMSI,2009,11,5.0,20,22,126,"Pleasantly surprised ....","Ok ... I was thumbing through a Vermont Country Store catalog, and found these things.  I thought they were a little steep for what they were, so I checked here on Amazon to see if they had them - yep .. and they were considerably less expensive as well.  I was skeptical at this point as to if they worked or not, but the reviews were positive.  They say you might not see results the first few times, but I did!  I use them overnight, and have been amazed at the results.  My wrinkles are not super deep ones, so that probably helps.  I wonder if my co-workers have wondered why my face has been smooth as a babies bottom lately? :)  They're wondering ... botox?"
B00027DMSI,2004,11,5.0,90,111,377,"Frownies are better than Botox!","I wanted to write a review because I have been using Frownies for over 8 months now and I am so impressed with them, as well as their other new products! I was really skeptical before I started using them - after all, there are SO many products out there claiming to help reduce wrinkles. But the cost was so reasonable that I finally gave them a try and I am so glad that I did. I had a really deep crease between my eyebrows and also had wrinkles at the corners of my eyes from smiling. I noticed a difference the first time I used them that lasted a short while (which apparently is to be expected) and after using them for 3 weeks, the results were lasting well into the day. They're amazing!		Because I'd had such success with the Frownies Facial Pads, I decided to try their new products, Immune Perfect and Immune Shield.  You cannot get these products on amazon.com but you can order them through frownies.com. Again, I was skeptical because I have oily skin that is very prone to breakouts, and I have always been VERY picky about the products I used on my skin. Immune Perfect is wonderful! I was a bit surprised when I first tried it because the texture is a cross between a cream and a gel, but my skin hasn't looked more radiant or felt softer in years! I get compliments all of the time about how good my skin looks - PLUS I'm less oily throughout the day and have virtually no breakouts anymore. I think it's a good thing that the texture of the cream is thinner though because it spreads easily and I get more for my money.		I'm also really impressed with Immune Shield. I've never used an oil on my body before - just lotions, but I love how my skin feels when I apply it. I also tan regularly and I've found that using Immune Shield after I tan helps my tan look healthier and last longer than the other ""after tan"" products I used to use.		I don't know how they do it, but I'm addicted to Frownies products for life now! For anyone curious, I highly recommend them."
B00027DMSI,2010,9,5.0,15,16,132,"They work!","This is my 3rd box of frownies.  I love them.  And they work.		It might be a bit of an adjustment at first.  You will kind of resemble the invisible man with the bandages on when you apply them.  There might be a little tug on the skin directly around the frownies but this is a minor annoyance compared with the price of botox and restylane treatments. And these work just as well.		I would definitely not recommend using them on a first, second or 30th date.  This should be applied in a comfortable setting around someone who won't freak out when you come out of the bathroom with flesh colored paper attached to your face.		But the main thing is that they work. Period. So you have to make the decision."
B00027DMSI,2011,9,5.0,1,1,303,"They work for me! Waaay more pleasant than my botox experience!","I have a giant wrinkle across the middle of my forehead and one that goes half way across just below it.		Tried Botox First....		I gave in and tried botox and while it did make the wrinkles go away, it felt just way too wierd to me to NOT be able to feel or fully move my forehead. The entire time it lasted (about 4 months or so...) my forehad felt heavy - like I had a piece of metal stuck in-between my skull and skin. It was just way too disturbing for me, so I decided early on that I didn't want to continue with botox. Plus - that needle in the forehead HURTS! So, big pain having it put in (yes, I'm wimpy, but for those who are more sensitive like me - it hurts!!!) followed by feeling like you have a metal plate stuck underneath your forehead skin. (Plus the knowledge that I'd purposefully allowed the injection a neurotoxin into my body...Aack!)		Decided to give Frownies a go......		I've been very pleasantly surprised. You stick these stickers on your head at night, peel them of in the a.m. (which also seems to remove dead skin, as my skin feels smoother...)and providing you do it regularly, your wrinkles decrease.		I'm not good about doing it every night - I forget. But if I do it at least 4x/week there is a noticeable difference. I'd bet it'd be full-on smooth if I could remember to do them every night.		They're worth a try!......		So, for the cost, you may as well give them a go. Just try to be better about putting them on each night if you want the best results. Like another reviewer said, they only work as long as you use them. If you quit, your wrinkles come back."
B00027DMSI,2011,8,5.0,1,1,201,Amazing!,"I am a young looking 40, but have had deep 11's between my eyes since my late twenties.... I started using botox when I was 38, and the dr said after about a year I should see a big difference. Funny, the botox imobilized my forehead, but I still had the lines, even after a year. Sooooo after a lot of hesitation and doubt about how they would work, I ordered frownies. I of course was having hormonal changes and so had all sorts of worries about acne on my forehead. My solution was to use an inexpensive benzoil peroxide product under the frownie pad right before I put it on. I also tore the strips into smaller size instead of cutting, so no sharp edges to make marks.  AMAZING result. I have to laugh, my botox dr was so proud of himself when I went in the next time, ""See,"" he said ""I told you it would take about a year!"" My lines are almost nonexistent, it's absolutely amazing. I figured out that even though botox had my forehead not moving, when I lay on my side my face would scrunch back into the lines! Frownies stopped this from happening."

B00027DMSI,2011,7,2.0,1,1,90,"Out of shape","A few years back Frownies came in a sort of wing shape, and it was almost perfect for placement between the eyes.		the current ""shape"" is a triangle, which makes no sense at all and has to be cut to fit the area.  The edges and points of the new Frownie come loose.  So far, after a month, I've seen no difference in the look of the wrinkles between my eyes, but when I remove the Frownie in the morning, there is a red patch which takes awhile to resolve."
B00027DMSI,2011,3,2.0,1,1,77,"Horribly designed!","Come on Frownies! You guys need to buy a clue and re-design these things. The first thing i noticed on these were the sharp edges that you have to bend upwards so they don't stab into your skin. You guys could learn something from DermaGen and re-design these with rounded edges. I will not be purchasing these again and would recommend DermaGen Anti-wrinkle patches to anyone wanting to try these. Atleast DermaGen has the more sensible design."

Even so, the crease between my eyes remained noticeable. I had read about Frownies for years, and I decided to try them. Was I ever surprised! I've been using them for only five days, and the crease between my eyes has changed dramatically. I don't know whether this helps or whether it's just in my case, but I use moisturizer before I put on the Frownie, and I wait until it's completely soaked in before applying the Frownie.

It's amazing, so I have no problem using these , because they work better than anything I've used. I still use my face cream during the day, and moisturizer on at night, around the frownies.

I am extremely happy and will always use Frownies, but their claim that you have to use them only for 30 days and then just for maintenance is bunk. I once went without cuz I ran out, and I got back my lines back in just one day.		I am enslaved to Frownies and I truly see using them forever, but it's worth it to me.		I wet them with a little water, stretch my skin, and plaster them on while pressing a towel on them. The towel absorbs any excess water.		I also use the mouth-corner ones and have done so for about a year as well. It DOES NOT reduce the smile lines, but it does prevent the smiles lines from getting worse and best of all -- it alllows me to sleep on my side without worry. I cannot sleep on my back.		I do not use the eye corner ones, so I cannot vouch for those. The box of mouth-corner ones come with the eye-corner ones, and I just use the eye-corner ones for the frown lines.		One tip: Recycle frownies by using eyelash adhesive on old ones. Frownies can be hard to put on at first and even when you are very experienced, and they work best on clean dry skin. If you have trouble, just try again with a new one and recycle the old one by using the eyelash adhesive the next night.		Good luck!	B"

I think frownies work best for expression lines (as opposed to dry skin wrinkles) that are formed when frowning or contracting the forehead muscles between the eyes--often done while dreaming, as well as sleeping on your side with your face buried in a pillow. (Even if I take an afternoon nap without wearing a frownie, I can sometimes see the expression lines return somewhat even after an hour or so of napping.) I recommend making sure the 11's are smooth and taut before firmly applying the frownie and using every night (or while napping) for best results.

I read the reviews and deccided to try the Frownies. I thought ,""It can't hurt and is cheap if it dose not work.""  It took me  a whole month of using them every night but I notice a huge difference.  I'm now using them about 4 nights a week and using Clinque products for my skincare.  I'm holding off on the botox for a few more years and have started growing my bangs back out again because my forehead looks that much better.  These work.  I'm a user for life."

These little sticker things work.  They prevent you from creasing your brow when you are sleeping, and those 8 hours or so really help!  You can actually feel how much smoother the winkle is after the first use, and after repeated uses the lines do look less noticeable.  No toxin injected into your skin either!  Worth every penny, I love these things!"

However, it works very well. I use it on a strong line between my brows. I used to wake up with a major frown line. Now, in the morning it's gone. It still appears if I concentrate or frown during the day but its less pronounced being I start my day without it. I only need the smallest triangle so these will last me over 4 months. Definitely worth the money for a natural way to decrease the intensity of lines."

Since I wore them overnight I feel like it retrained my skin to lay more still and not wrinkle or move while I slept. After the first use while I saw softening immediately upon removal of the adhesive from my skin I will say that over time throughout the day my skin went back to normal.  I still have hope that after using them for 3-4 weeks that the results may last longer throughout the day.  I'm hoping anyway!!  Perhaps I'll re-post with another review after that time.

Yes, it does take some time for the results depending on your skin, how deep the wrinkle is, and also being very consistent with using the patches.

I am 38 and was getting some 11's between my eyes. I wear them every night and it has diminished the appearance of the wrinkles between my brows. I don't find them uncomfortable, I rip them off in the morning with ease without wetting them. They are simple. Sometimes the best things in life are the simplest things, this isn't rocket science....it isolates the muscles so they cannot contract at night thus giving you 8-9 hours free of muscle contraction. Of course Botox would work better but for the cost and the fact that you aren't pumping toxins into your body with possible side effects....I say use the frownies.

B00027DMSI,2012,1,5.0,5,5,253,"I love them!","I have been using frownies on and off for over a year.  I had a wrinkle between my eyebrows that was so deep the lady who waxes my eyebrows asked if it was a scar.  I tried every cream and serum you could get.  I think I spent over $1000 on eye creams and wrinkle creams that my boyfriend asked why I didn't just get botox.  I bought frownies from drugstore.com based on the reviews there.  I honestly didn't think it would work.  How could something that cost $14 work better than the $50 creams and serums I've been using?  It took about 2 months of constant overnight use but my scar like wrinkle is completely gone and hasn't come back yet.  I pulled the frownies out of my cupboard recently because I am noticing crowsfeet.  I'm 36 and my skin is so sensitive that I can only take them off in the shower.  They are uncomfortable at first, but for the benefits I'm ok with a little discomfort.  Your face has to be clean in the area you put the frownies on otherwise they won't stick.  Don't wet them a lot (I just wet my finger and run it along the adhesive side) and spread your skin so the wrinkles aren't there before you stick them on.  Hold the frownies down on your skin for about 3 minutes until it feels like its firmly attached.  I apply them about 30 minutes before I go to bed and they stay on all night."

I didn't want any cosmetic surgery/chemicals, but I needed something to help those two deep lines to go away. When I saw Frownies, I was skeptical about it, so I found a local store that sold it in case I didn't like it and wanted to return it. I tried the Frownies for a month and saw a small improvement. This encouraged me and I continued using it for another month and saw even more improvements (I put them on every night). It's now been about 6 months and my frowns are pretty much gone, but I'm going to continue using Frownies to prevent the frowns from coming back. I say that because in using the Frownies, I found that I tend to frown at night when I'm sleeping. I could tell because the Frownies would feel tense anytime I would unconsciously frown as I was trying to fall asleep. I like this product and recommend it, but note that it may take some time to see some improvement."
B00027DMSI,2012,9,1.0,7,8,293,"Waste of money.","I regret buying this. I'm 25 years old and notices I'm starting to get worry lines on my forehead, so I bought these hoping to do some proactive damage control. I don't want them to get worse. While these did relax my worry lines, I still think these things are terrible and a waste of money. Here's why:		When you wake up, you'll have new lines from where your skin was pushed up against the edge of the frownies. Yes, they fade away after 20 mins, but this is how wrinkles form, over time you keep your skin in the same position and eventually it becomes a wrinkle. I don't want to use these products and then over time get NEW lines!		They are hard to stick on and feel uncomfortable. The first few times you remove them, it's going to take hair with it, and it hurts.		I wish I knew what the adhesive was made out of. You will feel a tingle and numbing sensation the first hour is is on. This worries me because idk what the glue is made of.		Finally, these things aren't cheap. I was planning on using these daily to prevent further wrinkles, but they aren't cheap and they aren't good.		I found another product that works better and it's cheaper! Medical tape. I use 3 pieces on my forehead every night. I don't wake up with new lines and it sticks easily without coming off or pulling my skin when I remove it. It's cheap, and I don't have to worry about what glue they use. I don't even feel them when I'm going to bed. Seriously, just go to the store where the first aid kits are, find the medical tape and have fun."
B00027DMSI,2011,0,5.0,4,4,104,"Day 2 and I'm speading the word...","I'm giving this product a 5-star rating on only day 2 based on the fact that the first morning after using I had an ""Are you freakin' kidding me?"" moment when I peeled that bad-boy off and found my brow wrinkle reduced by 50%. I've used lotions and potions to try to lessen it's appearance and the results are very subtle for 3-4x the money and time involved. The line comes back later in the day, but not quite as bad and since I'm only at day 2, I have high hopes I can avoid botox for a few more years... Very, very exited."

When I sleep in the frownies for a few days, the lines diminish significantly but don't disappear completely. I wouldn't expect miracles, but for the money, they do improve the lines enough that I feel like I can sweep my bangs off my forehead without my kids being scared I'm mad at them all day. It also beats injecting a nerve-deadening poison into my face, in my opinion. I think they're a cost-effective alternative."
B00027DMSI,2008,5,4.0,4,4,27,"Helps to maintain","Frownies do leave me wrinkle-free for a couple hours after I remove them. However, I think they are most useful for preventing wrinkles from worsening during sleep."

I ask if she had gotten Botox treatments but she said she was using Forwnies but that they had gone up in price at the Drug store so she's stopped using them. I bought her more for Mother's Day.		Using Frownies is not very attractive for you ""significant other"", having to wake up to seeing you with tape plastered onto your forehead, but I think that this bargain over the temporary results paid for Botox. Ugly mornings being what they are Frownies is something that he can live with for the short run if I can look smoother for the long run! ;-)		I'll give more stars in a few weeks after I see more improvements."

He even expressed an interest in getting some frownies for himself :)		The results are much quicker and more dramatic than any cream or laser treatment I've tried.  My forehead wrinkles are almost completely gone.  And Frownies are less expensive, a huge bonus.  I still have to pay attention to my facial expressions during the day.

It's not permanent, you have to wear them everyday or at least every other day (I wear them over night while sleeping).  It really smoothed out my brow furrow to where you can't even see it any more. They also helped with the lines that run from the nose down to the mouth on both sides of the face. One thing about removing them though, hold a warm wet washcloth on patches for easier removal, or it might be uncomfortable. With consistent use I have seen a dramatic change."
B00027DMSI,2009,8,5.0,1,1,299,"They actually do work.","I was skeptical, but after using these for about two months the skin between my eyes and on my forehead is noticeably smoother. I am 32 and had started getting ""expression lines"" across my forehead and between my eyes (I am a nose wrinkler and also an ""eyebrow frowner,"" meaning I furrow my brows when I frown) and my usual retinoids weren't helping that much. I thought about Botox, but it's too expensive and I feel like I want to wait awhile longer before going that route - if I start Botox at 32 I'm going to be using for it for a long time! My grandma had used these back in the 1970s and people always remarked about how young she looked - I figured for an under-$15 investment (vs $250 for Botox) it was worth a shot.		Within the first week the skin between my eyes, which had been getting this lumpy, ""pre-wrinkled"" texture, had smoothed out. Then the forehead lines went. I am really happy with the result. The other good thing is that the papers act like Biore strips and pull out anything that's clogging your pores, where they go on. I have oily, large-pored skin and that's helped the skin on my forehead look better too.		The investment here is minimal compared to how much some of the ""better"" night creams cost and one box lasts a long time. It is a little odd, when you first start sleeping with the patch on, but you get used to it pretty fast. If you have forehead wrinkles you're trying to get rid of, and don't want to go the expensive (and painful) injectables route, try these and see what you think. If they don't work for you, at least you're only out a few bucks!"
B00027DMSI,2009,8,4.0,1,1,91,"They Actually Work!","These Frownies really do work.  I have a really deep frown line between my eyes. If applied and worn all night I see a smooth area in the morning.  The line will re-develop by afternoon, but doesn't seem to be as severe as it was before. I've been using the Frownies for about 2 weeks. I find them to be comfortable and easy to use. Bonus is that if you rip the thing off in the morning (instead of using water) it saves you from having to tweeze between your eyes!"
B00027DMSI,2009,1,5.0,1,1,138,"Been using for over 6 months...","I use them every night for wrinkles in between brows. They really do work, little by little you'll notice wrinkle smooth out, still there but not as deep.		TIP: Use the Frownies Rosewater Activator Spray with this. It helps to enhance the effectiveness.		TIP 2: Results are gradual so give it more than a week. Everyone's skin is different.		TIP 3: You have to use them every night, I stopped for a week and noticed wrinkle gradually coming back...so I never stopped since.		Also for the past 4 weeks I've been applying a 'deep wrinkle' cream only in my wrinkle section (between brows)...I wait for cream to dry first then stick frownie. Not sure if it's the frownies alone or the combination of both but my wrinkle has completely smoothed out...almost gone. I'm very pleased with my results."
B00027DMSI,2009,0,4.0,1,1,87,"I love them!","I have used scotch tape in the past between my brows with no luck at all. After I remove my frownies in the morning there are no frown lines. Alas, the frown lines do eventually come back during the day, but the frownie definitely smooths the lines. I have to disagree with the other reviews about them being sticky and smelly...All I do is wet them down and hold them in place for less than a minute and they stay where I put them with no problems."
B00027DMSI,2012,10,5.0,3,4,319,"Awesome! Not only for women, who said that male's do not struggle with frown lines.","This really..really works!! I am a 30+ years old (Thirty something) man and was struggling with the frown lines between my brows.	This product is not just packaging tape or sports tape..this is legit stuff that works overnight.	I am very serious. What happens is that when you do use it overnight (I just got this product yesterday) The thin patch actually gets really hard like clay..so it's great because it concentrates only on the area concerned.	This morning when I took it off, my frown lines were less deeper than before and I can totally tell this stuff works.	Don't listen to those people who gives negative feedbacks. I think they might work for a dematologist that does Botox or something to that similar service because once you do use this product YOU DO NOT NEED THAT EXPENSIVE INJECTION and waste your time and money to go and get the Botox injection.	I used Hyaluronic Acid... you name it..all kind moisturizers and wrinkle creams...Germainium roller..they do somewhat work but Frownies is the MOST EFFECTIVE and the cheapest and quickest way to see the results immediately when you follow the instruction which is to use it overnight. I was very suprised this morning! My face looks younger!	It acts like a retainer or braces and streches out the frown lines out without any pain or worries and you can actually feel that you can't make those frown lines after you take it off.		So for those women (ladies) who have husbands or boyfriends who have frown lines..please have them use this..it's not embrassing..no one sees it (unless they are stupid enough to wear it outside from the privacy of their own home).	Guys..just buy it and use it and it works.. so you won't look older than you are.		Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to express myself this morning as I saw REAL effective results."

B00027DMSI,2013,0,4.0,0,1,271,"Perfect for Me!","This product comes in a small neatly packaged box with instructions. The product itself is unbleached natural kraft paper with a natural water based adhesive. There are 144 pieces. I bought these to help prevent those vertical forehead lines . I usually just have to remind myself to relax my face or do a simple facial massage massage. However sometimes my forehead scrunches up automatically and I don't realize it. I wouldn't mind wearing these around the house during the day but bought them mainly for nighttime use. Because they are something you cannot cover up with makeup. I do sleep on my stomach so I also thought they might help with the sleeping on the face wrinkles. They are very simple to use. Make sure you have a clean face. Then take one or two or how ever many you need off of the perforated stack and dampen one at a time to activate the adhesive and place in desired spot(s). Be sure to press down for a few seconds or more to ensure a good stick. Perhaps I did not wet the product enough before putting them on as the very tips of the corners stuck up a little bit. Or it could jut be the stiffness of the product in conjunction with my forehead shape. I do know that Frownies has a rose water spray for activating the adhesive. They also have other shapes for different parts of the face. Overall I like the product and would recommend it to family and friends as a simple at home way to help keep facial muscles from creating unwanted creases."

I am 55 years old with nary a whisper of these creases.  Others in my family of the same age are deeply creased.  It takes patience to begin using this product.

B00027DMSI,2012,5,4.0,2,2,171,"not a magical, overnight cure but there IS a difference","A friend of mine tried these and sweared that they worked, so decided to give them a try on those dreaded ""angry lines"" between my eyes.  I was honestly surprised & pleased to see that the lines weren't as bad as usual, when I woke up the night after first trying them.  Usually, upon waking, those lines are much deeper and then smooth out a little bit during the day, but it never occurred to me that sleeping was making them worse, more so than just day to day.		I can see how these would take a commitment, they only really seem to do good the day after you've worn them over night.  But I HATE those lines, so I'll take what little (natural) difference I can get.  They do also take a little practice to get them to stay on, but I haven't had any trouble since the second time.  I think I can even let my bangs grow out now!  I've always kept them just to hide those lines."
B00027DMSI,2012,5,5.0,2,2,223,"Pair with Needling for Excellent Results!","I have used these for about 30 years - off and on - but now that I am 59 it is more on than off;) I usually sleep in them but if I am going out for the evening to a special event I will wear them for 3 to 4 hours before I getting ready and they impart a fresh relaxed look to my face. I always receive compliments on my smooth skin.	You can wear your treatments after cleansing but let the lotions and creams sit for an hour on your skin to absorb, coincidentally this is about the amount of time your skin will absorb most of the nutrients while the pores are still open after cleansing.	For those who use needling treatments this works wonderfully. An hour after needling and treating your skin with Collagen  cream, lotion or serum apply the patches over the treated areas of most concern.  Leave them on overnight.  It creates a closed ""wound"" healing treatment speeding the ""healing and Collagen production"" process. This is a medical fact  and as a health care professional I taught this to many others. Needling , while excellent and with results akin to expensive lasar treatments, can make your skin look worse for a day or three while it works it's magic.  Applying a patch speeds up this process."

B00027DMSI,2012,5,4.0,2,2,78,"This product is great!","I have been using frownies for many years. i wear it overnight. Although it does not totally eliminate the frown lines in between my eyes, it helps smooth it out which makes it less visible. it also helps train the muscle to relax preventing the wrinkle to deepen. Sometimes i use frownies when i run outdoors when it's sunny, i just conceal it by wearing a cap. I love this product and i will keep on using it."

I naturally, was also using anti wrinkle products in addition to these but before I got the FROWNIES here ( BTW best price on the web) I was using the anti wrinkle products alone &  wasn't seeing any results!

B00027DMSI,2011,1,3.0,2,2,134,"The jury is still out...","I've been using these for about 3 weeks now...not really sure what to think yet.  I can see the logic behind them - keep the muscles from activating & there's less reason to crease.  However, they recommend you use them overnight - & I wonder how much I'd be wrinkling my forehead while sleeping without them.  Also, I don't see how I'd ever get to the point where I wouldn't need to use them every night & it'd just be maintenance.  In the morning when I remove them, I do see a difference.  But the difference seems incredibly short-term.		I will continue to use them for now, but jury is out as to whether I think they work as advertised.  Leaning towards no.		UPDATE:  Stopped using them.  They did nothing in the long run."

B00027DMSI,2011,0,5.0,2,2,346,"From a skeptic to a believer!!!","I was fairly skeptical initially that these would work but I had heard good things about them online so decided to give them a try. Because I'm in Canada I wasn't able to buy them from Amazon and instead bought them at a large natural health food store close to me. This is a very well respected store that carries quality products so I was somewhat more hopeful after purchasing them there. Then when I got home,  I was quite surprised and taken aback when I opened the box and saw that they were made out of what looked like gummed brown packaging paper! I guess I was expecting them to be more 'natural' looking and infused with some potent wrinkle-zapping concoction. Anyway I slapped the Frownie on between my brow, feeling quite silly as I did so, and went to bed.		The next morning, I was quite literally astonished. The vertical line that had grown more and more prominent over the past couple of years was gone! I'm not kidding. Gone!! I was stunned.		To be fair, the line gradually re-appeared over the course of the day (not so prominent as before but it was definitely more noticeable than in the morning). I've used these nightly for about a week now and the frown line is definitely disappearing. Now even at the end of the day, I can barely see it. And it had been something that I was so worried about before that I even grew my bangs a bit longer to help disguise the frown line!		I have absolutely NO idea how these work. The whole 'retraining your muscles' idea touted in the insert just does not make sense to me. I don't get it. But I don't need to get it. This is quite a remarkable product. They work and that's all you need to know.		I've tried a number of different wrinkle-fighting creams and fillers. This was easily the cheapest, easiest and most effective product I've tried so far to get rid of my frown line. I'm definitely a believer now!"
B00027DMSI,2010,10,5.0,2,2,211,"GREAT PRODUCT if you keep realistic expectations.","I saw this product mentioned as the 'Poor Woman's Botox' on the Today show and was so interested. I am a fair skinned 34 yr old with fine/deep lines on my forehead. I am very animated, my lines are definitely from all my expressions.		These are like stiff stickers that restrict you from using those muscles that continue to deepen/cause wrinkles. There is no magic ingredient to remove lines. The stickers give your skin a break. It doesn't allow your skin to wrinkle when your face is smashed into your pillow. I also throw one on at home when I find I am grimacing on tough days.		Another thing to consider, they are terribly embarrassing! I feel humiliated wearing them in front of hubby. I try to sneak them on and promptly hop in bed before he sees me. The first time he saw me wearing them he cracked up and told me I looked like I belonged on Star Trek. It's worth it ladies!		ADVICE! Buy the Rose Water Hydrator with this! It is wonderful stuff that I love! Great skin softener, especially when paired with a high glycerin lotion!		Good product if you know what it is and how it works! Even my hubby noticed my lines have lessened."
B00027DMSI,2008,1,4.0,13,14,192,"Temporary solution","To start, let me stress that everyone is different. So effects of this product may not be the same for everyone. I'm in my forties and have developed one frown line. After I started using frownies it has decreased quite a bit, but the smoothest is only when I take it off in the morning.		I talked to a skin specialist about frown lines and he said there are 2 causes: 1) as we get older the skin is thinner and more prone to creasing; 2) the frown muscles gets stronger the more we use it. Frownies address only the first point. It smooths out the skin, but when we frown throughout the day, we put the creases back. So if you stop using it, the lines will come back, unless you train yourself to never ever frown. As if you can!		One review says using scotch tape works the same. Perhaps it does, but I'm not going to put scotch tape on my skin every night! I am assuming Frownies have been developed and tested for long term use on the skin, but doubt scotch tape can be used like that."
B00027DMSI,2010,5,1.0,16,18,74,Frownies,"I paid $15 for Frownies...  Save your money, buy some mailing tape instead and cut it into small triangles.  These are cheap tear off forms of the same thing.  You could probably buy the twice the length of the same tape for maybe $3.  No go for me... the theory makes sense, but doesn't work like you would think. Scotch tape will do the same if you're diligent enough to wear it every night!"
B00027DMSI,2007,7,1.0,29,35,81,"Don't waste your money---$$$","I bought the frownies made for use on the forehead, and I agree with the previous posters-THEY ARE NOTHING MORE THAN PACKING TAPE!! I tried them for a month, and they did relax the muscles so that my lines weren't as deep, but I stopped using them for a week and my face returned to its previous state. Just for kicks, I put scotch tape on my face for a few weeks, and got THE SAME RESULTS I DID WITH FROWNIES."
B00027DMSI,2011,2,5.0,9,9,283,"With regular use, THEY WORK!","Three years ago I started using these at age 50 between my brows. (I also tried using the ones shaped for the corners of the mouth cause I had wrinkles there too, but they were way too uncomfortable and I gave up.)  I had wrinkles between my brows that made me look angry and was too chicken to try botox.  It took about 7 months of use every single night to get to the point where the wrinkles were reduced by at least 50% -- enough to make me feel and look much better.  I continued using them religiously for 3 more years -- the wrinkles continued to improve, but then stalled about about 75% improvement, maybe a little less.  That's good enough for me.  I trim them with a small scissor to customize them to fit exactly where I want them.  Recently, I stopped using them for about 5 months and the wrinkles started coming back, so I am back on track and using them again every night.		People wrinkle their brows at night without realizing it. This product prevents you from doing that and according to the description in the box, by smoothing out the  wrinkles then gluing these on for an 8 hour period, you are giving your body a chance to regenerate new cells and fill in the wrinkled area.  It may sound crazy, but i'm telling you it works. It is certainly better than injecting poison into your body and definitely cheaper. But you have to do it every night. You'll get used to it, I did! AT first it was a little uncomfortable but now I actually like the feeling cause I am so used to it."
B00027DMSI,2007,8,5.0,9,9,43,"These really work!","I thought they were a little Laverne and Shirley but I tried them anyways.  I was very impressed.  It totally takes care of the deep line between my eyes after wearing it for just a few nights, and the effects last several weeks."
B00027DMSI,2010,5,1.0,30,37,321,"HORRIBLE--These are the worst! Use hair tape instead.","I searched for awhile before I bought these. I was sure they would be just what I wanted. Instead, these are the worst things I've ever used. HONESTLY. I can't believe people would rank them as good. First, they are like cardboard. Much thicker than you'd ever imagine and very uncomfortable stuck to your face. Second, when you want to remove them, good luck. I'm no pansy, and I've never felt such pain!! The glue is like superglue and it RIPS the facial hair out around your eyes and your forehead. I didn't know there was even hair there, but this glue found it!! And man oh man, did it HURT!! It took me several minutes of soaking through the cardboard and wetting underneath each one to get them removed and my face was beet red for the longest time afterwards. Jeez! I was going to share them with my sister but decided I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy so I threw the rest away.		By the way, I have since been thinking about something that would work along these same lines and decided to try my mom's old pink hair tape. This stuff is PERFECT. Sticks well, even if you're wet, and doesn't rip the fine hairs off your face. Turns out I had the perfect wrinkle solution all along. :) I'm using the Scotch brand and love it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C510OW"">3m Scotch Professional Hair Set Tape With Dispenser * Created Especially For Hair Styling</a>		UPDATE: I've used the pink hair tape several times since and found that it works decent if you sleep on your back. However, the times I slept on my side and my face was bunched up, I woke up with horrific wrinkles on my crow's feet--much worse than when I used nothing! So, I'm revamping my recommendation to using a good night cream if you sleep on your side and forego the tape as well."
B00027DMSI,2012,2,4.0,8,8,246,"They look crazy, but they work!","After receiving a suggestion for this product from a great aesthetician years ago, I finally decided to try them, and I'm so glad I did! First, they look absolutely ridiculous while wearing them, which is the only reason I gave them 4 stars and not 5. BUT, they work. Every time I wear them to bed (when my boyfriend isn't around), I wake up to noticeably smoother skin between my eyebrows. It reminds me of when I was a teenager every time! By the end of the day, the wrinkles start becoming more apparent because the muscles are still moving to the furrowed position during the day. But, I rest easier knowing that on the nights I wear them, I'm not incurring 7-9 hours of damage by furrowing while I sleep. Truly amazing.		A few pointers for people trying them for the first time: 1. Wet the skin you're applying the sticker to, NOT the sticker itself. It makes adhesion much quicker. 2. I fold up the bottom, rounded section of the triangle after it's dried because the bridge of my nose gets in the way when I place the sticker where it's covering the entirety of my wrinkles. 3. These can safely be placed over eyebrow hairs, but make sure to moisten the sticker before (slowly!) removing it to avoid pulling out hairs. Unibrows aren't cool, but neither are eyebrows so far apart that they don't look like they are on one face. 4. Enjoy!"

B00027DMSI,2008,0,4.0,8,8,127,"They do work...","... at least they worked for me. My problem is probably a bit different  than most peoples'. I happen to frown in my sleep if I'm having a bad dream or not sleeping well for any other reason. When I do, I wake up with deep lines between my eyebrows. I'm not sure what the composition of the glue is and what anti-aging effects it has but Frownies are the thing for me because they at least prevent me from frowning. I've been using them for a few years now and the lines have disappeared almost completely.	I also ordered the ones for the mouth and eye areas but they did not fit as comfortably and I stopped using them. But I definitely recommend the forehead strips!"
B00027DMSI,2009,3,4.0,7,7,157,"They really do work!","I'm 26 years old and started noticing frown lines between my brows a few years ago. As they have become more noticeable, I've searched for ways to combat the problem. I stumbled across Frownies online one day and decided to give them a try because they were so cheap. I've been using them for a month now, and I can tell a difference. The fine lines are still there. However, the deep indentations that were starting to develop are gone. I did skip a night once and could tell a difference the next day, so be sure to wear them faithfully. Also, I have to wear them in the shower for several minutes before I can pull them off. I want to note that I AM NOT a rep for a company as one of the reviews implied. I'm a real woman with beauty concerns, and I would recommend this product to others with the same problem."

Skin that I'm sure is not supposed to be stretched like that.  lol  I don't know if I have a pea sized head or if I put too much water, etc.  Did not work for me.

What a great sight!  LOL  Of course, the 11s slowly creep back -- but, I will continue to use these for now and see what happens!"

I have a deep crease between my brows that began developing in my late 20s, early 30s. I shelved these until my sister bought some and she said she loved them. I'm now 52 and thought, why not try them again. I have them I might as well use them. So I did. About two weeks later, I subconsciously touched the crease and noticed it was softer. I looked in the mirror closely and realized it had definitely smoothed out some. I've continued and I do see the results. I don't know if the crease will go away completely, probably not, but the difference is definitely better! I'm sure if I had started using these years ago, it probably would have been better, but I didn't know about them. Regardless, I'm happy!"

I've recently been wearing them while I study at home, or drive long distances, and have found that they prevent me from the inevitable brow furrowing that accompanies both. While NOT wearing them, I find that I am more aware of furrowing, and stop myself from doing so.		I don't find them uncomfortable or painful, even to remove. I just peel them off without water. If I don't wet them, I have a better chance of reusing them next time.		One more thing....I've had a problem with teeth grinding while sleeping. Lately, I've been wearing the ""corner of mouth"" ones, and find that my jaw no longer aches in the morning - they must prevent the grinding movement! YAY!!!"

You look like you've had a stroke. Nevertheless, my last bout of bells in April 2012 caused the left side of my face to sag and it caused the wrinkle between my eyes to become longer and deeper, a deep deep crevice. Extremely noticeable. Looking in the mirror made me want to cry. I tried the creams, lotions, you name it. I, too, came across frownies online and after reading so many reviews thought I'd give them a try. What did I have to lose? The first night when I woke up in the morning it was laying on the pillow beside me. So much for that. The next night after I washed my face I took the frownie and laid it for a few seconds in the wet sink. When I applied it to my forehead, it stayed like a charm. When I woke up in the morning, the deep wrinkle is still there but nothing like before. In the morning when I wake up, it is practically non-existent. Yes, the line does come back during the day, but I've only been doing it for a few weeks. I'm willing to do this for the rest of my life. I think they're great. I had to laugh when someone said it was painful to remove them. A few splashes of water on my face in the morning and the frownie came right off. No pain whatsoever. (That reviewer should never have a baby)! I think frownies are great, glad I found them, and will definitely keep using them."

Yes, they feel like packing paper, but they've got something else in them cause after they dry on your skin, they feel VERY hard, which probably explains why they work. I've used them nightly for about 2 weeks now, and the 11 is starting to disappear. You definitely should wear them overnight. They're comfortable and stay on all night.		I also tried the ones for around the mouth, but haven't seen any results. This is probably because, after they dry, they're also very hard and you can't open your mouth.

But I wanted to give them another try and I'm glad I did.  I learned patience which doesn't come natural for me.		I am 38 and I use these under my eyes, for sleeping creases.  I cut them slightly to conform to that area.  I leave them on anywhere from 6 to 10 hours.  First day, there was a huge difference that lasted approx. 12 hours before the creases came back.  It's been over 30 days and I am really amazed.		After using them for 30ish days, I can now go 3 days tops before the creases re-appear.  So I use these every 3 days now.	Peeling them off can feel much like waxing but I learned to really soak them in warm water good, and I mean good, the more you soak the easier they are to peel off.

I actually think they would work better on frown lines that appear on younger people, because getting a jump on preventing deep lines from forming is a better alternative to waiting until they are set in with age.  I believe it will take many more weeks (or months) of regular use for me to see lasting results, which is why I gave Frownies a 4-star rating.  Unlike some other reviewers, I don't find them uncomfortable or hard to remove--they have to be somewhat stiff in order to ""iron out"" the frown lines firmly.  While I was willing to pay the somewhat high price to try them out, it appears the cost is primarily tied to the novel nature of the product rather than the cost of the materials, which is basically a small amount of special paper and glue.  It is clear that the profit margin to the manufacturer is very high.  But for those who are self-conscious about their frown lines and want to do something to alleviate them, this product may be a much better alternative to the expense of cosmetic surgery or botox."

But the Botox lasted only about three months, and then the creases and the headaches returned.  I was hooked on the Botox but not happy about having to renew it every three months.  Decided to use both the Frownies and Botox.  Over the past five or six years, the intervals of needing to renew the Botox have steadily lengthened.  It now lasts six months, sometimes longer.  I cannot tell for sure whether using the Frownies has contributed to the lengthening of the interval, but I do think the Frownies and Botox have a synergistic effect."

I find the shape of these little stickers to be poorly designed for the forehead area and tedious to apply.  Sticking a bunch of those little triangles on the forehead creates temporary new lines in the opposite direction where the sticker ends meet.  A more effective smoothing action would probably be created with one forehead patch and some smaller strips to fill out the rest of your forehead.  It is also hard to apply the second and third stickers because you get your fingers all sticky.  The other thing limiting this products effectiveness is that most anti aging lotions and serums that you would use at night make it almost impossible to get the things to stick on-so you have to take a gamble with one or the other products working-but not both.  When these do actually stick to your face, you will wake up with some improvement on occasion-but it is quite short lived.  I don't know, I'll try to make them work."

However, it has some flaws.	- The container isn't opaque, which means that the product is exposed to the sun. Retino - the key anti-wrinkle ingredient in this product - is known to break decay with exposure. So it should be kept in an opaque tube that is tightly sealed. That is not this product.	- The smell is very strong, and they clearly color it and use tons of perfume.  I can't imagine that this helps with anti-wrinkle or healing properties. But it does have the effect of driving my cat away at night because it is so strong.	- After applying my hands become sticky. Really sticky. Strange feeling, like they're becoming puckered. I immediately have to wash them. I don't know what this is attributed to, but it's quite unpleasant.	Overall, disappointed in this product. I don't think I'll be buying again.

After slightly less than a week, my face is blotchy and patchy, with red bumps and coarser pores.  The good thing is that now I know that my skin wasn't the worst skin ever known to human history; the bad thing is it got significantly closer to that unwanted title.		Some of the reviews mention that it's not fragrance-free.  I usually don't buy things that aren't fragrance free, but I figured that Olay, which does offer fragrance-free versions of other products, must have known it wasn't necessary for this product. I have had good luck with other Olay products, so I thought why not.		Wrong, wrong, wrong.  If you need fragrance free, don't make my mistake.  My face still hurts and looks nasty after two days of non-use--it felt so good and soft going on too!  Very disappointing.  So I'd advise continuing your search for a lovely magic night cream......

About 3 weeks after using both I began to develop little red bumps around my eyes, which is the only place I apply these products. They're not pimples, they're some kind of dry, itchy bumps and I've never seen them before. Also, while my skin and fine lines do look better after applying these products, I'm pretty sure that my skin actually looks worse now (more dry and more pronounced lines) when I wash them off. The products also contain several ingredients that are considered toxic to natural product aficionados. I'll need to research that more to know if there's any basis for the claim, but I'd simply suggest you do your homework. For now, I'm discontinuing use of both products.		I've been very pleased with this product. I'm only 30, but after 2 years of grad school (stressful) in the Northeast (skin-damaging climate) followed by 2 years of a stressful work situation, I developed fine lines and some deeper lines around my eyes. My eyes looked dry and tired and aged beyond my 30 years. I tried various products but nothing has helped as much as this one in combination with the daytime Regenerating Serum. The fine lines are less noticeable, the deeper lines are still there but softer looking, and my skin is generally more healthy and youthful looking. I also quit my job! :)		My only complaint is that this product has a perfumy scent that is bothersome because I have chemical sensitivities (i.e. allergies), and in general I don't care for scented products. The daytime Regenerating Serum has a fragrance-free option and I've written Olay asking them to make a fragrance-free version of the nighttime cream available as well. If you feel the same, please email Olay at[...] to let them know. On a side note, the perfumy scent seems to lessen in intensity after about an hour."

I haven't had any of the usual big cystic break outs on my chin since I have used this combination consistently for over 3 months now. I also had a really bad case of super flaky dermatitis on the edges of both sides of my chin, surprisingly, this lotion cleared that up too! So now I use it on the patches of psoriasis I get on my neck and chest and forearms too and they always go away after a few days of applying it.	 Now let me tell you, I am so sensitive to products I would have THOUGHT that I would be highly allergic to this OTC drugstore name brand cream with chemical ingredients; this after trying organic, fragrance free everything in order to clear acne and dermatitis, but NOPE this works perfectly!

This product is a little richer, for night time use and has kind of a weird purple-ish color.  Not sure why they added the color, but the cream feels good on my face and keeps it feeling moist all night.  It doesn't really get rid of existing wrinkles but hopefully it'll delay the formation of new ones.		I'd prefer a product without fragrance.  This has a light fragrance that seems to dissipate after a few minutes and it's not really offensive.  Still, I'd like to be able to order one without the fragrance.

B0007W1R58,2010,4,5.0,4,4,175,"Great Product","To be honest ladies, when I buy a moisturizer I don't expect it to get rid of wrinkles; all i expect is that it will do a good job of moisturizing my very very dry skin; Up until this past month I used Clinque Moisture On Line exclusively; it is a wonderful product with no scent; that product was discontinued. I have spent the entire month buying products on the internet and at the drugstore trying to duplicate Moisture On Line; guess what, the only product that is the closest is Olay Night Recovery Cream; yes the color is putrid (sorry Olay) and the smell I could live without (but I can tolerate it); this is a really good moisturzing cream; if I want to get rid of wrinkles I'll get a facelift; If I want a moisturizer that makes my skin moist and smooth, I will use this product. By the way the only difference between a night cream and moisturizer,as I understand it is that moisturizer has suncreen and night cream obviously doesn't."
B0007W1R58,2009,4,3.0,4,4,50,"Good product, no miracles","I've been using this product for about 18 mos.  The smell is fabulous, and it feels great on my skin.  Absorbes quickly and is not greasy.  Does not make my face breakout, and is great for very dry skin.  As far as any other results, I haven't seen any changes."
B0007W1R58,2012,5,2.0,6,7,142,"It stinks!","I just received this yesterday and used it for the first time last night. Oh, it smells. It is heavily scented, and I can't for the life of me - in a time when everyone is going back to natural, organic and unscented - figure out why they loaded up a product for use on your face with so much fragrance. And it's floral. Ick. If it were lemon or peach... maybe. But old lady floral? I kept getting whiffs of it as I was trying to fall asleep. I'm not sure that I can use this product long enough to give my honest opinion of whether it works.		I will try it again tonight, using less than last night, and applying with a tissue (I could not wash the flower smell from my hands). The things we do for beauty! :)"
B0007W1R58,2009,7,5.0,6,7,167,"Everyone should try this night cream","I bought this night cream last winter when I ran out of my expensive department store brand cream and I was shocked to discover that my skin which is well-cared for and pampered to begin with, but dry and sensitive and 38 yo feels as smooth as a baby bottom in the morning when I wash it. I am POSITIVE there is a firming/tightening effect at the jaw area (not that I'm sagging, but there was a similar effect to $110 cream I used prior to that) - that was a huge PLUS. Also it MOISTURIZED very well for the winter. I already bought another jar for use in the fall. I gave one as a present to my younger sister and she loves it too!	I have to add that I have a very sensitive skin (that can fell dry&tight, peel or become red) and it never caused any allergic reaction either, so I have options besides Clinique now in times when nothing feels ""quite right""."

For the past month, I have been using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream along with the serum during the day and the Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment at night. Now, people are telling me how my skin is absolutely glowing and how pretty I look.  All I wanted to do was get rid of the wrinkles around my mouth, which this product did, but I didn't expect to look prettier.  At almost 54 years old, I can't tell you what a kick this is!"

B0007W1R58,2009,8,5.0,3,3,143,"I love this cream!","I love this cream. I just started using this a couple of weeks ago and I have seen dramatic results already. My under eye dark circles lighten a bit, the wrinkles in my eyes are now softer, and my facial pores are smaller. I have few people commented already about how my skin improved a lot and they wanted to know what product Im using.		The only negative thing is that, a few days ago, my skin started to break out (under the jaw). I just used an Acne wash to control it. But Im not sure if it is this product that is causing the breakout or it is that monthly thing where our hormones (women) are all whacked out. I think it is the later because I always break out when my period is about to come (sorry too much information)."
B0007W1R58,2009,7,5.0,5,6,237,"(HELPS) WITH DARKNESS IN EYE AREA","Well I tried this because I subscribe to consumer reports and they said that the eye cream is usually the same as the face cream but the eye cream is more expensive. So I tried it on my face but I have very oily skin it worked well but I had a breakout but I continued to use on my eye area and I do notice a big difference from before they are not totally gone but they sure have lightened up alot. By the way I am african american but I am very light skin and before using the cream someone asked me who hit me in my eye (no one hit me in the eye they were just dark circles) because it was a little darker than the other but after using the cream they are the same. so it is worth a try and consumer reports said it works better than th $300 creams.		""Moreover, the luxury-priced skin-care offerings didn't work any better than the drugstore brands. La Prairie Cellular, the most costly product we tested ($335 for an ounce of day cream and 1.7 ounces of night cream) was among the least effective.

I was a little scared when I saw that it was a purple color, but who cares what color it is if it works! I think that this cream may also be good if you have occasional breakouts. I have noticed a reduction in my blemishes after using this cream as well as minimized pore size. I kind of had bigger pores around my nose but they're shrinking. It really feels wonderful to put this cream on before bed; I feel like I'm feeding my face a good, balanced meal so that it can be plump and fresh in the morning.

There's no difference to be made for 20-something skin - the most important thing is sunscreen at that age.  Don't waste your money on a night cream that doesn't really do anything for you.	That being said, all of us older gals DO need something that does make a difference.  I became hooked on this product several months ago.  I cannot go a day without it.

B0007W1R58,2011,6,4.0,0,0,259,"Amazing Moisturizer, but..","I bought this moisturizer because I 1)needed a new one and this had great reviews on amazon and 2)I decided to get an ""anti-aging"" one because someone guessed my age was 30 and another guessed 27... I am 18! College = lack of sleep which equals baggy eyes and fine lines. I am not overly concerned about it since I am young, but I am not going to lie that I became concerned about starting a routine to maintain my young skin. So I decided to buy this and am happy I did! It is a very deep moisturizer, the smell is lovely, but strong! So people who are sensitive to smells or dislike them beware, but it does smell nice. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, this is greasy, so you might need to watch out for that! I am acne prone since I am still in my teens, but I have had no issues with it besides the fact it makes my face oily, which is why I apply it at night.		The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think this is an amazing moisturizer that really goes deep into the skin, but I feel that is all that it is. I do not see ay difference in firmness of my skin, or less fine lines, etc... but then again, I am 18 so it can only do so much to young skin I guess. Overall, I recommend it and will buy this again because of how moisturizing it is."
B0007W1R58,2011,6,5.0,0,0,318,"Great for young oily/acne prone skin too!","I have moderately oily, acne-prone skin and it's been difficult trying to find a moisturizer that doesn't break me out or make me too greasy.  Most creams tend to clog my pores and make me break out in stubborn comedonal pimples or make my face way too shiny, but this stuff is absolutely great.		This night cream has a weird consistency; it's VERY thick and almost mousse-like.  I only have to use about half of a pea sized amount to cover my entire face.  Surprisingly, it leaves a matte finish which is great for people with oily skin.  I feel like this cream actually gets absorbed into my skin instead of sitting on the surface.  My face feels ""spongey"" and soft.  When I wake up, my skin feels plump and youthful (no oil slicks!).  There is a light floral scent though, and I wouldn't recommend this to people who are sensitive to fragrances.		So far, I've been using this cream for 6 months, and I'm just now running out.  I know this stuff is intended for nighttime use but I've also been using it as a daytime moisturizer as well.  The jar is rather small (1.7 oz), but a  little goes a LONG way with this product.  If you sign up for Amazon's subscription, you can get it for around $12.60 every couple of months...and that's what I like to call a bargain.		After using this in addition to a BHA exfoliant for a while I rarely get comedonal acne and my face feels hydrated and dewy (NOT shiny).  I'm only twenty-one so I can't really comment on any massive wrinkle reduction claims but it does seem to fill in fine creases near the eyes and mouth.		***CONS: Seriously the only negative thing I can think of is the fragrance (goes away after a minute), and the lack of sunscreen since this doubles a fantastic daytime cream too."

When I wake up in the morning my skin looks healthier and firmer.  Originally I wasn't sure if it was this product or the Regenerist Sculpting cream I was using during the day.

Definitely, there's something in the Regenerist line that caused my reaction, and I've never before had any sort of reaction to skincare products.

I tried a variety of methods (cutting it with other lotions or water) to get it to absorb better, and I'm sure *eventually* it absorbs, but it's uncomfortable in the meantime, and I find myself wiping it away through the remainder of my evening routine.		THIS lotion requires very little application, and absorbs into dry areas almost instantaneously leaving the skin soft and elastic (awesome-I can tell when my skin has had enough immediately).  My skin doesn't feel like it needs more moisture later on, and I'm less oily in the morning. They must use some very nice ingredients because it doesn't feel greasy-(well, it does if I apply too much), and seems more expensive per ounce than most facial creams at the store.		I feel bad for the women who have reactions to the lotion-I was one of those people with scarring acne in high school, and continued to have painful acne into my 20's, and fortunately this lotion has been nothing but great for me.  I have noticed that many of the reviewers who have had reactions DIDN'T have traumatizing acne as teenagers so maybe that should be taken into account when ordering this for yourself (probably because I had to try everything under the sun when I was younger, and my skin has learned to cope as a result).		It doesn't make me look younger by any means, but I don't like the feeling of my dry/tight skin stretching when I move my face, and that issue is gone when I use this cream."

Though it is only a night lotion and I wish it was for both day and night. It goes on really smoothly, doesn't feel greasy at all, and makes my skin feel super soft- like felt! I wish there was something similar with SPF protection for daily wear. When I wake up my face feels plump with hydration, I have less prominent bags under my eyes and my skin still feels smooth, not greasy. I have made this part of my nightly ritual as it makes my skin feel so good. My only complaint is that upon application it makes my eyes sting a little- nothing too bad, maybe it's from the scent? But it seems like before it dries and sets that the scent or fumes from the lotion make my eyes water a little. Once it's dry I don't notice it any longer and it doesn't take long to set.

Also I occasionally use Olay Professional ProX clear lotion which seems to help with breakouts but is not nearly as moisturizing.

I do not necessarily feel like I have had a mini face lift every night.  That may a bit of an exaggeration of a claim, but the moisturizer overnight is great.		I do love the automatic monthly refill program.  It comes to me, no shipping, and at a discount.  I have the option to change frequency, or to discontinue at any time.  (However, the price has gone up each time it is sent to me.  I guess that is due to their supplier?  It is not nearly what you would pay in the store, so it is still a great deal.)

When I saw that I can get it for half the price here on Amazon I decided I might as well try it because of the price and I also ended up getting the Olay Regenerest Eye Illuminating Cream (which I love!) I got this in the mail only a few days ago but so far it seems like a pretty good hydrating cream. I only have two complaints with it so far - 1.) the scent. Unlike all the other reviews I don't care for the scent at all. It seems a tad overpowering for a night cream.  You'd think they'd make it a little more subtle. Also, the smell reminds me of a grandma. Or this aweful hand lotion my mom used to use in the early '90s! But I guess this cream is targeted for someone a little older then I am?  and 2.) everytime I put it on, it stings my eyes a little and they go red! And I don't even get it anywhere near my eye area. But other then that it's a non-greasy, extra moisturizing night cream thats worth giving a try if you haven't already.

Thankfully this product doesn't have that problem. Goes on smooth (and you only need a very small amount) and leaves your skin feeling smooth, even on waking. Follow up with the daily moisturizer, and it's a good combination for your skin. I don't have problems with blemishes or acne, etc., but my skin leans toward dry, particularly in the winter months (as it does for many/most(?) women if they live in homes with central heating/AC--any moisture in the air is sucked right out by all that dry heat). It's true that a good portion of the cost of these types of products is in the packaging, but the Olay Regenerist line is worth the price, IMO. The only other line, similar price range, that I find that works equally as well is that made by AVON. As for application, you only need a small dollop to smooth over your face and neck; any more is really overkill and won't make your skin any softer or firmer--you'll just go through the jar more quickly. If used as directed, one jar of this should last you about 3 months (at least that's been my experience; I live in the mid-Atlantic region, so we have very humid, hot summers; the remaining seasons depends on Mother Nature's mood!).		Definitely recommend."

So far I'm having good results, although I have noticed quite a few small pimples I feel like it's worth it. I'm going to use the product until it's done and then see where I go from there.

You can feel and see the difference in just 15 minutes but without a doubt there is a big difference in my skin in the morning.

I bought the night recovery cream along with the eye serum, face serum and daily moisturizer.  I'm not crazy about the eye serum and the daily moisturizer has a strong fragrance.  I do like the night cream though.  It is very hydrating and makes my skin feel soft.  I can't say I love this night cream though.  It's thick and gummy in substance.  However, I think it's a very good product for the price.	Update:  I'm now using the regenerist micro sculpting cream and I find that it's not as hydrating as this night cream.

I use the Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment at night on my whole face and neck, after washing with Dove Regenerating Calming Night Soap (liquid, navy colored bottle) and I use Olay Smooth Skin Exfoliating Scrub about once or twice a week at night.  In the morning, I use Avon ANew Eye Lift Cream around my eyes and then Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream on my entire face and neck. I think this combo, particularly the Olay Regenerist products have made me look YEARS younger--with the grace of God, of course.  I added the Regenerist Night Recovery about 2 months ago, and it made a difference for me. Lots of people at work tell me I look younger, too.  My skin feels great!  It's firm and velvet soft.  And wait till I tell you, I have lost 50 pounds in the last 9 months!  Why do you care?  Well, my face should be sagging all over the place with that kind of a weight loss, especially since I carried that weight for years and my skin was well-stretched.  I should need a crane just to hold the wrinkles up! Guess what??? It's firm and velvet soft.  I won't say I don't own a wrinkle, but they are very very minimal. I've had people tell me I don't have wrinkles, too, but there are little tiny ones there hiding in the makeup. Oh, I'm 57, too--so don't think I'm 25 and telling you I don't have wrinkles like they tell you in those adds on TV. It smells great, too. I am sensitive to certain products with perfumes, but not this. No problems.		I am mighty pleased with these products, BUT, use them awhile.  Nuthin' happens overnight, Hon!

After two weeks of use, I'm pretty pleased. I'm skeptical by nature, and I wonder if anyone notices the change produced by skin products like these other than the user. But, I think this stuff does make the skin around my eyes look smoother and lighter, and it certainly moisturizes without being greasy. I have pretty sensitive skin, and I haven't had any redness or irritation, and certainly no pimples. I also don't notice any scent. I find eye creams especially irritating (Clinique was AWFUL for me!) but the eye serum is very soothing. I'm pleased with the results and certainly the price!		Update 9/13/09		Well, I spoke too soon about not having trouble with pimples. Lo and behold, about six weeks after I began using all these products I noticed a few dreaded little red bumps, plus one larger one right in the center of my nose. Ugh! I've never had acne, even in the worst of the teenage years. After much trial and error over a couple of months, I think I've identified this item as the culprit. I notice it doesn't say that it's ""non-comedogic"" on the label, which I think basically means it won't block pores. I haven't had an issue with the other items in the Regenerist line, though, so I'd continue to recommend them."

This product is a must for me.  It seems to be an excellent restorative (youthful look) and ""preventative"" (of wrinkles) --moreso than an extinguisher of wrinkles.  Used alone, it greatly reduces the no. of new wrinkles but doesn't ""bust"" existing ones.  Other products used in conjuction with this (see Kathy W.'s review) seem to be the secret in banishing and keeping ""age tellers"" at bay.	  I have tried going without this night moisturizer but when I do, the wrinkle busters don't work as well, my skin loses luster,and new, fine lines appear.	  This product, for me, is essential in maintaining optimal skin health and appearance, and so far, no other moisturizer can come close to matching its benefits."
B0007W1R58,2009,1,5.0,7,7,144,Awesome!,"I started using this in combination with their daily regenerist cream. I couldn't be happier. I look at least five years younger and it has taken away that tired, drawn look. My wrinkles are much less noticable. More importantly, as I have tried tons of products, it has reduced my under eye circles. This is no small feat. I have super dark blue, very hollow/sunken-in circles that, even with cover up, are still dark and shadowed because they are sunk in. This has plumped up the skin below my eyes, and, in addition to getting rid of much of the wrinkling, it has made it easier to put cover-up on the remaining discoloration, as it has taken away at least half of the sunken in look and darkness. Really a big difference in only a week of religiously using it. I highly recommend this!"

I was amazed after a few weeks that the lines on the olay side were fading while they were not on the other.  I am in my early 40s.

Hey, if spending that much makes you feel superior, as opposed to spending a fraction of the cost to achieve the same or better results...that's called stupid).		To be used as reference, I am in my early 30s and keep my skin in good shape already with plenty of water, no alcohol, no smoking, and plenty of UV protection in the occasional times I spend time in the sun.  The fine lines that I had been starting to notice are due to the inevitable effects of age, but this Olay product does a good job of halting (even though ultimately, I know it's a temporary thing) the aging process."

I feel great when I apply this cream, and feel it adds a lot of moisture to the skin.  It didn't do much as far as anti aging, (reduce wrinkles etc) but for the price, it's better than going to be without trying to improve the skin.  Good product for the value."

I haven't been using it too long, and it definitely takes a week or so to see results, but now I notice when I don't use it. Overall smoothed out skin, helped with break-outs, not oily - goes on really smooth and absorbs well. Definitely works best right after you wash your face. I don't know about the firming part, but I'm a teen, so it's not much of a problem for me yet. Overall, I like it, nothing bad about it, really. oh! some people say it smells bad, but I like it, a very light scent, I don't notice it once I rub it in. I also use the Olay 7 in 1, and they seem to work well together. I always have luck with Olay products. :)"

In recent years however they have developed exceptional anti-aging products. Tests being conducted all over the world are substantiating what many of us knew all along: Olay's anti-aging products are as good as, & in many cases better than, many of the fancy $200+ products sold in specialty stores.

B0007W1R58,2010,4,2.0,3,8,327,"I call it Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Smurf Paste","I am going to be completely honest here: this stuff looks and smells like someone took Vanity Smurf, pureed him, and put his remains in a jar. It is, for lack of a better description, a tacky blue mess with a hint of floral odor. The texture and feel of it can best be described as warmed lard. After applying this product my skin felt like cyber skin. I don't really want my face to feel like a real doll. Last I checked human skin wasnt supposed to feel like high quality silicone. In parts of my face it sat on my skin and although I couldn't see the smurfy goo, I could feel it... It made me feel like I had a heavy foundation on (despite the fact I used a spare half pea sized amount for my whole face). I resisted the overwhelming urge to wash it the smurf off, and left it over night. In the morning I had several plugged pores and white heads. Yay.		This stuff is pretty nasty and I didnt feel at all like I was taking care of myself when I put it on. It was not at all creamy or luxurious or even pleasent. It was like spreading congealed bacon grease on my face, nasty.		I am giving it 2 stars ONLY because my normally red skin was much less red after using it, which is pretty darned rare.		I wish I had bought something else. I am going to contact Olay and see if I can get my money back. With the plugged pores I can't see giving it a few more nights. I also purchased the SPF 15 lotion and the eye serum and I'm not even going to open them so I can return them and get my money back. I opened the night cream first so I could get a feel for the products. I got a feel. I don't like what I felt."

Oh my...))) trust me, if your skin tried the BEST- it will NOT accept an imitation.I gave Regenerist 3 weeks of try- every...EVERY time I am using it, my skin breaks in bumps, next morning it feel very greasy and definitely not refreshed.	Anyway, to make my story short- you can try it ( 20 dollars not such a big loss) but you will come back to your $300 cream-since ITS WORTH IT!)))"
B0007W1R58,2009,5,1.0,8,12,203,"Caused severe breakouts","I typically have very good skin. It is on the dry side but I do not have acne -- in fact I break out very rarely (just the occasional hormonal pimple or two). When I first opened this cream, I noticed the fragrance was unpleasantly strong, but I put it on anyway. When I got up in the morning, I had horrible red splotches and whiteheads all over my face. Some of them were even painful cystic-type sores beneath the skin on my chin and jawline. I stopped using the cream right away, and I haven't gotten any new pimples, but the old ones are taking days to clear up. It totally ruined my week to have my face covered in painful pimples and crusty sores. Thankfully I didn't have any big events to go to, or I would have been traumatized.		On the plus side, I called the 800 number on the back of the jar, and the Olay representative was very courteous and helpful. She said they would refund my money (since Amazon doesn't take returns on opened cosmetics). I have used the eye serum without problems but I will not try the face creams again. Just not worth the risk."
B0007W1R58,2011,3,2.0,4,6,211,"Going Back - Scent Overpowering","I bought this tonight after doing a lot of looking for a great ""drugstore"" brand anti-aging/antioxidant night cream.  This got high marks and reviews from a number of sources.  I thought the consistency and texture were fine, not too heavy and spread easily.  It has a light violet color, certainly didn't notice once it was spread on.  I was  not prepared for the overwhelming perfumey smell.		The Smell:	No sooner than it was on I was thinking ""This isn't good..."".  If you've ever been to the movies, you've surely encountered a heavily-perfumed woman who you can smell from the moment she walks in.  You just hope that she doesn't sit by you...and then she does.  Within minutes you know you can't make it to the end of the show let alone eat or drink anything with that stench permiating everything around you, so you get up and leave.  That is the intensity of this scent - I had to wash it off. My husband said he could smell me from down the hall, before he reached the end, and I was sitting in a room around the corner.		I can not give it another night, it's going back tomorrow.  WHY on earth do companies feel this intensity of smell is appropriate?!?!?!"
B0007W1R58,2012,7,1.0,2,3,93,"Allergic reaction?","I bought this cream because of the Olay rebate. I should have known better, as I've had problems with allergic reactions to their products before, but thought maybe they have gotten savvy to the fact that you don't need STINKY perfumes and DYES in a face cream! The first night I tried it the smell kept me awake. Not only that, my skin actually felt drier! The next morning I woke up my cheeks and nose were swollen! OK, I waited another week and tried it again. Same thing. Swollen face, no thanks!"
B0007W1R58,2012,6,1.0,2,3,86,"like glue","I was very disappointed with this product. It simply stuck to my skin like a coat of glue and did not moisturize at all. After several hours I had to wash it off, scrubbing with a rough washcloth. I tried if eventually on my legs and elbows just to use it up, but even then it was like a layer of sticky goo.

My facial issues now are:  dry, thinning skin, wrinkles aound the eyes and mouth, and the beginnings of verticle wrinkles on one cheek.		When I first purchased this, I used it both day and night for a couple of weeks, then night only.  I don't know if I wasn't paying close attention or what, but I really didn't see much of an improvement in my skin; definite softening and the wrinkles didn't seem to be as deep but were still noticably there.  So I only used it sporadically at that point, just using my usual moisturizers instead.		Last night I noticed that the wrinkles seemed to be deeper again.  So I grabbed the jar and smoothed it over my face, adding a bit more to those verticle lines on the one cheek...WOW!!  Seriously, they are barely visible today.

It smells like you sprayed yourself with an old nasty perfume, YUCK!.... I hope I don't break out from the fragrance.

Evened out my ruddy complection, mini lift indeed. But I can't give it 5 stars because of the two pimples that appeared and the awful stench of it. I hope that they will listen to reviewers and make one that is naturally scented or fragrance free!!!! I'm thankful that my face isn't red or irritated looking so that is also a HUGE plus. Hoping my skin won't break out more than it has and get used to this new night cream. It does seem a little on the dry side for my skin, but it is winter and my skin has been in need of something different which is why I purchased this at Walmart. My face doesn't appear as dry however, but feels a little tighter and dry to the touch. Tighter is good, my face needs a little lifting. I tend to switch products a lot because my skin gets iritated by them overtime, and yes from experience, I agree that price doesn't mean a product is better.		I'm 34 years old (most people don't believe me and think I'm 25), I have fair and very dry, sensitive skin with ruddy undertones.

Honestly, I was trying to avoid it being obvious I had cancer and looking for any way to keep my skin, hair, and nails looking normal. After using the Olay website's product recommending tool, I tried the Regenerist Night Recovery treatment. Two and a half years later, I'm still using it because it's the best night moisturizer I've used.		What I like is how a little goes a long way. I don't need to coat my face to achieve great results. I also really love how this doesn't feel greasy like a thick ointment. It's light and thin, yet still leaves my face feeling and looking fresh. When I want to do an intense treatment (especially after a few Minnesota winter nights in front of the fireplace), I'll use a lot more product and cover my face with a warm, damp towel for 30 minutes for a quick facial.		When my face is a little drier than usual and I want to look extra nice for a date night with my husband, I'll use this before putting on makeup as a smooth primer.

I use this with the other Regenerist products.  I'm not saying it's a miracle cream; my wrinkles are still there; but my skin feels so much smoother and softer, and it seems like the wrinkles are slightly minimized; not as glaring.  Great product, great price.  I tried some of those fancy over priced creams, and this is much better."

B000GFSVK0,2012,8,5.0,2,2,197,"Best Vitamin Skin Cream on the planet","I research supplements.  This cream works because it contains potent antioxidants.  I have used it for many years and can state without hesitation it does work to prevent wrinkles and age spots on your skin.  Some of the ingredients inside are also available to take orally and work to reduce aging effects.		Use this cream lightly on your skin morning and night. It is a vitamin cream and not a moisturizing cream. Don't use it on sunburned skin as the Vit C content will create irritation on sensitive sun burns and the glycolic acid (from fruit juice) tends to exfoliate and you don't want that on burned skin.		To supplement this cream orally, take Ascorbyl Palmitate 500 mg (Vit C in fat soluble form), to prevent further wrinkles, and fade out freckles, age spots and melasma.		Also take Alpha-Lipoic Acid, DMAE, Fish Oil, and CoEnzyme Q10 for skin and overall health.		After using this cream for a few days you will notice your skin is finer, smaller pores, spots fading out, and a brighter glow.  Wrinkles take longer. This cream is not a miracle cure but you will see a definite and visible difference on your skin."

The 4oz lasts me a year with using it every day. I have used it for about 10 years (I think - it's been so long) and hope they never discontinue it.

It is my ""go-to"" cream when my skin is looking sallow, grey or just plain blah. (I'm now in my late forties.)		First, the good. This cream has a fabulous texture that quickly sinks into the skin. I like the kiwi fragrance, and don't find it at all overpowering, and I am sensitive to ""loud"" smells. It is packed with great ingredients, such as lipoic acid, DMAE, vitamin C, alpha-hydroxy acids and more. This is no lightweight, in any sense of the word. When I use this cream consistently, I notice a firmer overall tone and accelerated skin turn-over. Within a week of consistent use my pores look smaller, age spots and freckles are diminished, and my skin has a nice glow.		The bads: I imagine people with very sensitive and/or oily skin might have issues with this roster of very potent and rich ingredients. Don't use this cream anywhere around your eyes, or you will wake up with stinging eyes! (Ask me how I know . . .) Since there is no spf included, this is strictly for nighttime use. I don't like it as a makeup base, as my foundation tends to ball up on top of it.		My favorite way to use the Skin Eternal cream is just before bed, after a mild cleansing and exfoliation.  I usually buy this at my local health food store, but Amazon's price is better. I find that the 4-ounce jar lasts at least 6 months, sometimes longer, with regular nighttime use.

I constantly get compliments and remarks on my skin and this makes me feel great.  I've had several people ask me what I use on my face - crazy thing is I often just rinse my face in the evening with warm water and nothing else, then finish with this cream.

The manufacturer recently changed their usage recommendation. They now say it should be used at night. It was recommended as a daily moisturizer. I still use it that way, although it does make me a bit shiny.		Pleasant smell. Lasts all day. Good for day or night. All in all it's a great product."
B000GFSVK0,2012,7,3.0,3,3,776,"Am I missing something?","A little background - I read about the effects of DMAE, C-Ester, and alpha lipoic acid in Dr. Perricone's book, ""The Wrinkle Cure."" I am 29 and I have crow's feet when I smile (and a line or two all the time, even if I'm not smiling), lines under my eyes (a few when I don't smile, and several more when I do smile), and dark circles under my eyes. I also have large, visible pores and a few red spots where I have broken capillaries. When I smile, I notice fine lines all over my face, and those pesky lines that go from the nose to the corners of the mouth (sometimes I see the lines when I'm not smiling). All of these problems supposedly can be helped with the use of DMAE, C-Ester, and alpha lipoic acid. I should mention that while I think have awful lines and wrinkles, my friends and family don't think it's so bad (but then again, are they just being nice? Or is it really not as bad as I think?)		Last year, I tried the Derma E Rejuventating (or was is Revitalizing? It was something that started with an 'R') creme, which came in two 1 oz. jars, so I used it until it was gone. I noticed that my skin was a little firmer. Not in a way that someone looking at me could see, but if I pulled on my skin a little, it felt a little... thicker? fattier? It feels like there's more substance to it (though I haven't gained weight, and my face doesn't LOOK fatter). When that ran out, I tried this product, the Skin Eternal Cream. From all of the reviews and the product description, it sounds like the ideal cream that has all of the effective ingredients at an affordable price. I've been using this every night before I go to bed for about two months now (several of the reviews say that it will take a month to notice any effects). First, using my fingers, I apply it around my eyes, then all over my face. It is a greasy formula, and the smell... It really is like some of the other customers have said. It's a little bit like popcorn + coconut (or something tropical) + medication. I have gotten used to it over the past two months and I don't notice it at all now. I've been vigilant about using it every single night, and so I have to be vigilant about washing my face every single morning, because so much dust and fuzz and whatnot from my pillows now sticks to my face (not visibly, but when I use a cotton ball to wash, I can see that there was stuff (like lint or something) on my face, which didn't happen with other moisturizers I have used). After two months, the only change I have noticed is that my skin is a little bit firmer, like with the other cream. However, the lines, wrinkles, crow's feet, dark circles, etc. have not improved at all.		I read so many of the positive reviews that I really am starting to wonder if I'm missing something? Am I doing something wrong? Does anyone have any tricks for applying this? I plan on using it until I run out, and then I'll search for some other product with DMAE, C-Ester and alpha lipoic acid. This product doesn't bother me or cause me any problems, but I haven't seen any real results. (Ok, it's a LITTLE weird to be so greasy/shiny at night, if anyone calls me and I've already applied this stuff, I won't go out.) I really would appreciate advice from anyone who uses this. Does anyone apply it twice at night? Or in the morning? (The directions on the jar say to use it at night, and that there is a different cream for the daytime, has anyone used that as well?). Or are there tips in general for applying moisturizers and face creams?		Honestly, my wrinkles aren't awful, and many people don't think I'm 29 (but maybe it's my personality, who knows?), so I didn't think that I would be expecting much by hoping that my wrinkles would go away. But they haven't diminished AT ALL. If someone asked me for a recommendation of this product, I might say, ""Eh, go ahead and try it. It made my skin feel a little firmer. For a lot of people on Amazon.com it seemed to work wonders, but I didn't really see an improvement. But it might work better for you. It wasn't awful, so I wouldn't 'not recommend' it."""

I have used it for a few weeks and I was so happy with how my skin looks I didn't realize that this is why my eyes were burning every morning.  I am careful not to get it in my eyes, but when I wake up it almost feels like pink-eye (but it's not).  I'm fine once I put my contacts in, and I'm fine when I don't use the lotion, but if I try to go back to it, my eyes burn.

The scent seemed to me like a tanning lotion...not ""coconut"" but like many tanning lotion scents I'm familiar with from my tanning bed days.

I take a little cream on the tips of my fingers and run a little water over it and rub it into my face which drowns out the thickness, smell and burn.

B000GFSVK0,2012,3,4.0,1,1,452,"Better than I hoped","I gave a 4 star instead of 5 because I've had the product a short time.  But I expect it's worth 5 stars. I did a lot of research and then bought this product. I hate to post after only having it a week but others have commented after years of use and I couldn't wait.  I love it.  I put it on the backs of my hands and they already look more youthful.  I have VERY thin skinv (as I get older) and my veins were beginning to show through (yikes... I'm wearing my mom's hands). My hands already look plumper and younger.  Now, my face is reacting as well to the product.  My skin feels and looks plumper which means less wrinkles.  Very natural and healthy looking already.  I'm hoping for more changes as time goes by but I am very please with just the improvement so far. It feels like almost 10 years have vanished in just a few days.  Is this even possible?  I'm really happy with the product. Love it!		Some have complained about the smell.  I don't have any problem with it at all.  It's kind of a coconut smell.  Perfectly fine.  Others commented about the texture.  It is rich.  It's not a watery cream so it doesn't take much to get the job done.  My jar will last a long time.  The first few times I think I put it on way to much.  I'm learning just how much will be absorbed.  I think when I have the sweet spot on absorption then it won't feel as heavy on the face.  But it isn't bad and I'm more than happy to work with it. I just need a bit lighter hand.  Results are what I'm looking for and it's giving me what I wanted.  It does leave an after shine but I'll be playing with finishers to add after it's absorbed so that my makeup/or no makeup looks better.		Several posts mention eye irritation but I thought I'd be more careful and have no problem.  I think that the product sinks so well into your skin (which is a good thing) that it's not that you get it in your eyes but it's absorbed into the eye socket ares and you start to tear.  I was supper careful each time and it still happened.  So I order the eye cream for this area.  It apparently doesn't have the acid component but everything else so it cuts down on the irritation.  It will be worth it because I want to use it for both day and night.  Perhaps my sunscreen will matte the finish a bit.  Anyway, love the product. Arrived as expected.  Couldn't be happier."

I waited to rate it until I was sure it helped. Well, in my opinion, it has worked remarkably well.  I use this cream far more faithfully with my sunscreen than any of the others, and yesterday, my puppy was trying to get me to play with her and before I knew it she scratched down my exposed arm several times, and I was amazed to find she had not broken the skin!

My face looks like a model's after using it for a month","My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/DoPrb ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!		Hyaluronic acid has been nicknamed by my personal physician as the ""key to the fountain of youth"" because it has been noted that at least some people who ingest a lot of Hyaluronan in their diets tend to live to ripe old ages.		He told me the enormous benifit of it:	1. Hyaluronic acid moisturizes skin from the inside out, smoothing out wrinkles in the process.	2. Hyaluronic acid helps people who need to ease the flexing of their joints, especially their knees, by restoring cushioning to their joints.	3. Hyaluronic acid is suitable for men and women in their 30s and 40s who are beginning to see the first signs of aging.	4. Hyaluronic acid is suitable for seniors who have established joint conditions.		My personal physician told me that Hyaluronic acid is essential for the health of the synovial fluid which supports the bones and joints. To maximize the benefit, he asked me to take it with Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM for my joints problems. I decided to have a try and was recommendeded to buy at goo.gl/7CEUP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!! Usually vitamins and supplements take a few months to work but I can tell you that this product has made a DRAMATIC difference to my skin and I've only been taking it for 2 weeks. I am 42 and I have not been kind to my skin due to sun damage and harsh products used on my face for adult acne. I am simply amazed at how moist my skin feels but it's not oily or greasy.

You should notice a difference in a short time. I use it all over my face, under my eyes, on my neck, back of neck and chest. It absorbs quickly without being greasy.

It smelled like something I shouldn't be putting on my body skin, let alone on my face. It felt sort of tingly, but it didn't burn or turn my skin red, and I figured I paid a lot for it, so I used it anyway. After a couple weeks, it seemed to smell kind of like pina colada, which I grew to like after adapting to the strength of it.  But after 2 months of use, it smells like the fragrance added to it has long surpassed its expiration date, and it has officially become a boyfriend repellant.		Although my eye cream can't penetrate this product (I mistakenly put my eye cream on after the face cream one night), and that probably shows that the face cream helps your skin retain moisture (moisturizer can't get in, so maybe moisture can't get out, either), I still haven't seen any significant results that are any better than what most any drug store cream I've tried can provide.

The texture and aroma of the DMAE Cream is different from the SE Cream...a lighter consistency and a ""prettier"" smell, but the SE Cream is more recommended for nighttime use.

B000GFSVOQ,2013,0,1.0,0,1,390,Warning,"In October 2010 I purchased Source Naturals L-Tryptophan. It was recommended to help me with light insomnia. One hour after taking only two 500mg capsules I became desperately ill and my health has continued to decline to this day to the point I am now housebound and cannot stand for more than a few minutes due to terrible pain. My experiences led me to write two books about what had happened, the horrors myself and my young family have had to endure because I took only two Source Naturals L-Tryptophan capsules. Before and after writing the books my research turned up some very alarming information about this so called ""natural"" company. They produced L-Tryptophan in the 1980s which caused the disease I have now to endure, EMS, or Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome. They were litigated to be held accountable to the victims killed or disabled for life. Tryptophan was then banned for a period of more than a decade. And now? Source ""naturals"" think it acceptable to buy their Tryptophan from China, where it is usually made from duck feathers, (diseased or not). They do not tell you this on the label, the label on the bottle states ""made in the USA"" which is a lie. The Tryptophan is imported from China and merely put into capsules in the USA, then sold to an ignorant public. Legally it is a disgrace, although they are permitted to act in this manner by current legislation. So why should you care? Why should you stop buying Source Naturals? For one reason. They are a firm which does NOT have the consumers interests at heart. They are interested mainly in profit, as there are sources of ethically produced Tryptophan around (plenty of them), but Source Naturals consider it more profitable to buy in bulk from the one country we have all heard so many horror stories about when it comes to foods and supplementation - China. If you wish to keep buying Source Naturals products I wish you well, and I hope and pray that you do not contract a horrible disease from their products as a result of their greed, as I have done. Think for a moment before you press that buy button - the Source Natural product you are about to buy may well have an ingredient from a VERY un-natural source."

It's not as creamy as Skin Eternal and the smell is more like a cotton candy smell.  The serum burned my face and made it itchy...I took it off immediately.  Then I tried the cream -- no bad reaction to the cream.  It's just so-so.  I honestly prefer the regular Skin Eternal cream as a better night cream.  There are other products to remove brown spots.  Beware of this one.  Like other reviewers, I DO NOT have sensitive skin.  The only other time I had a reaction like that was when I was a teenager and tried a Mary Kay product (never again!).

As an adult, my skin was ok, with the occational acne break out, but since I've been using the cream, my skin is sooooo smooth and refreshed and its really beautiful. BUT, as a woman of color it did ""lighten"" my skin which is the down side. However, it will only lighten your skin to your natural complextion since your face is exposed to the sun more. So expect, for example that your face will lighten to the complextion of your skin underneath clothing. Its a very natural change, not too dramatic but something I did not expect or want.So I've changed my routine, and only apply it at night and use a different moisturizer during the day.

It had been left out in the sun for about an hour and although it didn't get really warm that day the cream did liquify enough that it came through the hairline crack enough to damage the label. The crack probably wouldn't have been noticeable if it hadn't gotten warm. I just put some tape over the glass as the product seemed fine. Just check your jars.	The cream itself; well, it really does work! My skin is quite obviously firmer, more lifted and shows fewer wrinkles. It is quite a shock. I was skeptical about this and took a chance. I'm not disappointed. One thing you should know and I feel in fairness I have to mention. The makers of the cream have done their best with the scent - it has a fruity kind of smell but they could not fully mask the fish oil odor it has. It's not overpowering but it IS there.

I'm im my early 50s and had been fortunate to have clear, smooth skin in my 20s and 30s.  But in my 40s I developed rosacea and blotches and of course started to lose elactisity with age.  I had been using the neova products which have helped with my discolorations and did help firm my skin, but the products are very pricey.  Recently I was watching a talk show with a guest dermotalagist and she recommended using products with dmae and ester C.  Thus my search started and I found Skin Eternal DMAE cream.  I started using the cream about 2 months ago and after only a few weeks I not only noticed that my rosacea and blotches completely disappeared, but my skin was MUCH firmer.  Friends were commenting how great my complexion looked!  Now I've been purchasing additional jars for my friends and family."

Purchased this and tried it before I went to bed. My neck and face turned bright red, puffy and extremely itchy.  My skin dried out and became flakey.  It took almost 2 weeks to get my skin to feel normal again.  I emailed the company but they never responded.  I am now using it as a hand cream."

I have been using this product in conjunction with the Skin Eternal Cream and I am now noticing a big difference in the appearance of my skin.  At 53, this cream has firmed my skin, evened out the skin tone and I think taken a few years off.  I have just reordered, usually I buy a cream, use it for 3 months and never see a benefit, but this one is different and I think I will have to start hoarding it.

B000GFSVOQ,2011,9,5.0,0,0,533,"be patient!","<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFSVOQ"">Source Naturals Skin Eternal DMAE Cream, 4 Ounce</a>		I was looking for a paraben-free product with as many skin-boosting ingredients as possible...and when I saw the price of this one, I had to give it a try.  It's half as much (at least) as the next cheapest product I found online (and that one's ingredient list wasn't quite as impressive as this one's is, either).		At first, I was disappointed, I'll admit. The smell is weird (not gross, really...but strangely ammonia-like once it's on my face.  Luckily, it fades, and my husband and daughters tell me they've never noticed it, even at close range).  The feel on my skin isn't the best...it tends to stay somewhat tacky (could be I'm putting it on too thickly), even through the night.  I do notice some very slight tingling when I first apply it, but this doesn't last long (and I have sensitive skin).		I had been using it for about a month, and had decided that I'd finish the jar then move on to something else (""too good to be true"", I was thinking).  Then I woke one morning, looked in the mirror, and my face was noticeably brighter.  I leaned in close, and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth that had been giving me such agonized nightmares were noticeably fainter.  And they've continued to grow fainter still.		I have been using this 4-oz jar for about 2 months now, and still probably have a month to go before it's empty.  I put it on at night, and in the morning (I work from home...I doubt I'd wear this under makeup, since it seems to stay so sticky.  And the weird smell...).  Of course, I'm also taking a whole suite of skin-boosting supplements by mouth (DMAE, Co-Q10, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin E, collagen, etc., etc.).  And, I'll admit that my skin issues are minor...I started this regimen to slow down the few minor signs of aging I'd begun to notice, as I approach my mid-30s.  A few fine lines, some faint mottling.  But, whether due to this cream, the supplements, or both...my skin looks downright amazing now:  fresh, supple, bright.  I'm pleased, to say the least.		As cheap as this product is (especially compared to creams with the same ingredients marketed by some of the big names...you know the ones), I'd say give it a try.  But:  don't expect it to do miracles overnight.  Give it a few weeks to do its magic (and maybe help it along with some oral supplements, too!).		My biggest complaint about it now is that it doesn't seem to moisturize very well.  When I rinse my face in the morning, my skin often feels a bit too tight...so once or twice a week I skip a day and use a good moisturizer instead.  I could probably mix the two.  I'm tempted to try another product when this jar is done, just to see if anything else can maintain these results (I wouldn't mind a less sticky, less smelly, more moisturizing cream -- especially with winter on the way).  But I don't think I'll find anything with this complete cast of ingredients, for anywhere near this price."

The user reviews on this product on Amazon.com were good.  However, the product from Amazon.com smelled differently from the sample I got from a salon.  I thought this is from Amazon.com so it should be reliable and just put up with the bad smell.  Even though the product also felt different on,  At the beginning, other than the smell, it seemed O.K..  However, my eyes (or skin around the eyes) then got puffy and itching and peeling after a week or so.  Initially, I was not sure why the skins around my eyes were itching as I often have allergies during summer when flowers are blooming.  I then stop using it and everything is fine now.  The peeling and itching were terrible -- I have never had such reaction to ANY eye creams!  I just wasted $40 and suffered the irritations -- I suspect Amazon.com got the product from a ""fake"" source.  However, I don't want to go to the salon to get the ""real"" one now as I don't want to risk to have the bad reaction again."

I'm in my mid 30's and sleep deprived for a long time. I have been fighting deep bags and hallowing of my eyes and fine lines.  Within 5 days of using this cream (and not getting more sleep), my eyes look more awake and my make-up seems to look better than it did before. I have gotten compliments, including an ask if I had botox done.  I have even seen a lessening in the dark circles.  I don't know how dermalogica did it but I am a believer.  I would give it 5 stars but since I am only 5 days in, I want to test it for a month and re-review (I will).		Please note that I have previously tried every product under the sun, even the VERY expensive ones like Chanel, La Mer, La Prarie, Prevage, etc.  Please note that NONE of these products worked for me at all. Dermalogica may be my savior as not only does the product work, it is absolutely affordable!

Through the years, I couldn't justify spending that much on an eye cream while in college, so I'd try other things (Clinique, Almay, etc..) and they were always either too greasy or made my eyes water/itch constantly throughout the day. I also flirted with other skincare lines during this time due to cost, but my skin was never as clear and glowing as it was when I used Dermalogica products. I'm now almost 30 and have been using this eye cream daily for the last 2 years. I only wash my face 1x per day (I also use a Clarisonic brush) since I don't need to wear foundation & my skin is extremely sensitive. All I do at night is remove my eye makeup & rinse afterwards. I only use this eye cream in the morning (a slightly-smaller than pea-sized amount) and a single tube typically lasts me 7-9 months. After letting it soak in for 5-10 minutes while getting ready, my eye makeup glides on beautifully and it helps my concealer stay in place. If I put it on without the eye cream, I can tell a major difference. Now if only they could put some sort of dark-circle reducer in it, it would be 100% perfect in my opinion!"

Especially if you try using it the way I do.... Which is in the tub after using hot water to wash your face and open your pores.

They now make a milder version for sensitive skin and one for drier skin for those who can't tolerate this. I would like to remind everyone though if the body isn't properly hydrated or the skin too stimulated by caffeine consumption or high histamine levels or hormonal imbalances, anything you put on it will sting/burn...There are nice mud masks out there (I also like bioelements restorative clay for deep cleansing) but nothing quite like this.

It can be used to soothe surface burns (although I probably wouldnt use it on sunburn) and poison oak and/or ivy. My brother accidently found himself in some poison oak right before my sister's wedding and I put this on his arm - it healed in no time! Not in time for the wedding, but faster than it would otherwise. I will say, however, the first time I used it there was a strong tingling sensation, but afterwards my skin felt clean and refreshed. Also, since it lasts so long, should it dry out - just add some water. If youre wanting to try this product, I say go for it! If you dont like how it makes your skin feel, then you have something to help treat minor bumps, burns, and even poison oak!!! And who couldnt use some of that on occasion?!		Oh!

It is perfumed, so if your skin is sensitive that might bother you, but I have medium-sensitive skin and it doesn't bother me at all.		FWIW, I did get the sponge with mine, though I only got the application stick the first time I bought it (which was at a department store, so maybe they threw it in)."
B0007RXGZM,2011,4,4.0,2,2,171,"Quality facial product","I am fan of face masques because they make my tired face feel refreshed and rejuvenated feeling and this product is one of the best I have tried so far. I have tried various other brands before, but some take a long time to dry, others become itchy as they dry, but Borhese is comfortable to wear and the consistency makes application and clean up easy. Mine came with an applicator sponge, but I feel that I would waste too much and just use my fingers to apply it. Like other reviewers I have noticed some skin sensativity after use, but applying a nice moisturizer with shea butter usually takes care of the problem quickly. This item comes in a very attractive box and so would also make a nice gift that is easy to wrap. I like the glass jar much better than other brands that come in a tube because it is easier to use and you need only take how much you need at a time preventing waste."

I have never tried any other ""acne system"" so I can't really compare, but this did it for me. It was pretty drying to my skin, but only for the first week or two.

I don't have bad acne, but it keeps my skin clear and SUPER soft. I just bought it for my brother (who has bad acne) to see how it works on him.  Save the 20 bucks, buy the Klear Action!!!!"

My blemishes were under control, to a point, but my skin was constantly dry.  I wanted to try Proactiv, but the price and the commitment to their ""club"" was not really up my alley.  I decided to buy Klear Action instead.  I have been using this product for less than a week and my skin looks great, and not at all dry (even with the benzoyl peroxide in the repairing lotion).  I have to say that I truly love this product.  It has given me the skin I've always wanted.  I would highly recommend this to anyone considering Proactiv.  The price is great, and the results - FANTASTIC!"

However, I have been on it now for 5 weeks and the only thing I can say that is positive about it is that it has evened out my skin color and made my skin glow without make up. with that being said though my acne has NOT improved even a little bit!  I think it is actually worse.  I am glad it worked for others I was just not one of them!"
B0000AN9LA,2009,4,5.0,2,2,46,"Klear Action Acne Treatment","I bought this product for my son who has a real problem with acne. He tried it for a month and it made a big difference in his appearance. We just ordered another one. It's much cheaper than other treatments advertised and it really works great."
B0000AN9LA,2009,3,4.0,2,2,140,"Extremely effective but destroys cloth","I switched from using Oxy Pads to this after the Oxy Pads simply weren't cutting it anymore.  When I use Klear regularly (cleanser + toner twice a day) I get no break outs whatsoever.  My only complaint about this system is that the acne repair lotion (the small bottle) absolutely destroys clothes and towels.  I keep ending up with bright orange and red spots on shirts and towels because of it.  Even after thoroughly washing my hands its destructive power remains.  Overall though the benefit of being acne free outweighs the cost of a couple towels and a few shirts.		One piece of advice you buy this, don't put any acne repair lotion on your neck or underneath your chin.  Your skin will come in contact with your shirt at some point and your collar will be stained and ruined."

I do not have severe acne but once a week or so I will get a noticeable blemish or two and was hoping that by using this product regularly I could prevent breakouts.	In the month I have been using this package I will use the wash, astringent and moisturizer once in the morning and once again before I go to bed. My acne has not improved, or has it gotten worse.		The only change over the month I have been using Klear Action is a noticeable drying of my skin which I have had to use a separate moisturizer to combat. I live in a very dry, very cold climate with extreme wind almost constantly so the drying was a bad side effect but might be more sought for other users in more humid climates.		I gave this product 3 stars because it didn't really help, and it didn't really hurt. I was tempted by the price tag of this product which was much less than that of other acne packages, but maybe if I had paid more money I would have gotten more noticeable results."

I had been breaking out for 20 years non-stop but this product finally allows me to go out without having to put on make-up or concealer to cover up my blemishes. Proactiv worked in the beginning (though slowly), but after a few months of constant use it stopped working. I continued using it, blamed my breakouts on hormones and diet and such, until I gave up on it. One time my store was out of Klear Action so I bought the AcneFree instead, which made my skin break out within only a few hours. My reaction to that product was very severe. Not only did I get surface pimples, but also very deep ones. Instead of preventing acne, AcneFree caused it. I drove all over town to find another box of Klear Action (most stores were sold out) and within a few days, I was free of acne again. I love this product."

I used Klear Action for about 5 months and noticed that it did not control acne flare ups the way that Proactiv did. The Renewing Cleanser in Klear Action doesn't give the same ""clean"" feeling that the Proactiv brand does. I had constant breakouts on my face all the time. When I used Proactiv I had clear, smooth skin, and NEVER had breakouts. I have decided that cheaper is NOT always the best.

I wanted to try ProActiv, but I simply couldn't bring myself to make the commitment or spend the money. After reading reviews I decided to give Klear Action a try, and I am glad I did. I didn't have to order it and wait for it in the mail. Stores like Target and Walgreens sell it for $19.99. You get the cleanser, toner, and repair lotion in one kit, so I think the cost is reasonable.	I started out using it once a day, since I normally dry out with most cleansers. The first thing I notice was that my coloring and texture were evening out. My skin felt smooth and I was not so blotchy red. Over a few weeks my skin felt softer and the breakouts are minimal. BREAKOUTS STILL HAPPEN, BUT MUCH LESS AND CLEAR UP VERY QUICKLY. After a few months of use, I can honestly say this is a great product. I have had such progress with once a day that I have raised it to twice and am still liking the results. I am now including Oil of Olay's Total Effects Moisturizer in my regimen to decrease those fine lines and wrinkles. They work well together. My skin feels better and looks better, dare I say...younger even.	For twenty dollars it is definately worth giving a try!"

I used Retin-A, tetracycline, erthromyacin, benzoyl peroxide, etc. I used accutane at 18 and worked wonders for me for several years. However, at 26 the acne is creeping back up again, and accutane is not an option any longer (TTC and rumored to be taken off the market.) So, long story short I was getting frustrated. I bought klear action and was impressed. It works quite well and doesn't dry out my skin too much. I'm impressed, good results and a decent value. It's definitely worth a try."

I've tried what feels like every over-the-counter product available.  I was doing moderately well using Neutrogena products when I decided to try Klear Action.  After 3 weeks most of the blotchyness was gone.  After 2 months I had about 2-5 pimples a month that came and WENT QUICKLY. At the 4 month mark I tried to be cheap and use AcneFree.  Big Mistake.  All my progress went bye-bye.  I went back to Klear Action and am VERY pleased with the results.  I can finally wear red or burgundy with out it bringing out redness in my face!  I use it twice daily religiously and will not bother trying any other product.  This truely works!"

Add in that my darling husband isn't as blessed as I have been with my skin, and he needed some help! I was considering proactiv but with most of our income going to diapers price was a big consideration so I thought I'd give this a try. Thank goodness I did, my face is perfect now, my husband's looks infinately better and its so easy to use with only 3 quick little steps (although I'd add a good moisturizer with sunblook, especially love Olay 7x).

I started applying once a day instead of twice, but it didn't matter, my skin kept getting dry and I kept getting pimples.  After five weeks, I had to discontinue use.

The scrub does help with some of the smaller pimples. but overall these products are just okay.  They are not as good as Proactiv.  This system does not include a mask which is one of the things I like best about Proactiv since it seems to clear up bad pimples very quickly.

From there on out, my acne (and even my skin) got much better. If you're looking for a quick fix this in not the answer, but if you given time it will improve your skin.		As a caveat, I had to take a business trip for a few days and couldn't use it, so my skin got MUCH worse. So there is some dependency involved.

I tried a lot of products but they seem to work at the beginning and then don't. With this product I don't get many breakouts anymore, and if I do it is one or two small blemishes, but nothing too bad. I think this product compliments what the birth control pill does for my face.

However, this product never completely cleared any of my stubborn acne, so don't be surprised if it works on some acne but not all of it. What I really do not like about this cleanser is that its extremely overdrying. And the moisturizer does not work on extremely dried out skin. I don't know if the toner helped at all, but if you want to save money, just buy the cleanser if you can. I would actually recommend Biore Ice Cleanser over Klear Action. You can buy it right in the grocery store, not online and it only cost $5.99 for 6.7 oz. I saw a difference in my skin tone with Biore Ice Cleanser but not with Klear Action. Another minor negative thing about Klear Action product is that it doesn't lather too well, making you think you need more soap which uses the product up quicker. Despite all of that, I would still recommend Klear Action (after Biore) because it did help with minor blemishes."
B0000AN9LA,2005,11,4.0,2,3,107,"Worked for me!","My skin began having several breakouts a month due to pregnancies, getting older and seasonal changes.  I was so fed up looking and feeling like a teenager, worrying if my face was going to breakout before a special event.  I tried this product because it was cheaper than others and was pleasantly surprised at its effectivness.  I saw results within two weeks and had no irritation.  I have been out of it for about for almost two weeks now and my skin is returning to its old ways.  I will definately be ordering more and will continue to use this product for its effectivness and low cost."
B0000AN9LA,2005,5,5.0,2,3,19,"Most Effective Ever Used","The cleanser and the cream work well. They prevent the gigantic ones, thought occasionally I still get tiny ones."
B0000AN9LA,2004,3,5.0,44,44,276,"Great Product--don't give up on it!","My 12 year-old daughter, who has the biological body of a 16 year-old, had been seeing a dermatologist since she was 10 (she had already been living with acne since she was 9). None of the prescription medications worked, even though she faithfully stuck with the various routines. She just got more pimples and peeling red skin. She drank lots of water, ate healthy foods like salads and fruit, exercised--despite her best attempts, nothing would improve her complexion. After 2 years of red, peeling, skin and more pimples, she was disheartened and hopeless.	  Out of desperation I purchased the KlearAction kit for her, and were we ever surprised to see that IT ACTUALLY WORKS.  She had to play around with the routine for a while to get optimum results. For example, in the winter she does 1 facial wash and only 1 lotion application per day, while in summer she does 2 washes and 2 lotion applications daily.  She found that the toner was too strong for her face, but we put it on her back and that clears up the acne situation there.	  The other day, while we were driving along in the car and she was peering into the vanity mirror, she casually announced, ""Mom, do you know I have one of the best complexions of all the girls in my school?""	  I have nothing but positive comments to make about this product, which I understand is basically a generic rendition of ProActive, at 1/2 the price.  It lasts (for her) about one to two months, as packaged, which breaks down to a very affordable $15- a month.  I urge you to try it!"
B0000AN9LA,2004,4,5.0,22,23,206,"Better than Proactive","I was worried to use a different product other than Proactive and when I heard about Klear Action. I was worried that if I changed my skin care regimend my face would breakout really bad. I tried Klear Action because it said it was just like Proactive and it was half the cost of Proactive. The Klear Action face wash is much better than Proactive because it isn't watery when it gets wet like Proactive does and it isn't so gritty either. I notice the same results from Proactive as I do with Klear Action except I notice that Klear Action doesn't dry out my skin near as bad as Proactive did. The only complaint I have about Klear Action is that the scent is a little overwhelming at first but that was just my reaction to it, now the scent doesn't bug me. I have suffered from acne for many years and I still do, Klear Action and Proactive have not cured my acne but they keep my skin under control. I am very happy to have found Klear Action because I can afford it and I don't have to worry about money when I buy Klear Action like I did when I used Proactive."
B0000AN9LA,2004,4,3.0,15,15,82,"pretty good, but not proactiv","I used Proactiv for a few years before trying Klear Action.  I switched because Proactiv was just getting too expensive, and the fact that Klear Action is half the price appealed to me.  It is a pretty good system, and my skin is fairly blemish free.  I do still get a few here and there and the condition of my skin isn't nearly as good as it was with Proactiv. But because of the price, I'll probably continue to use Klear Action."
B0000AN9LA,2005,7,5.0,17,18,392,"Just as Good as PROACTIV.....and $25.00's CHEAPER!!!","I am 24 years of age, and I have been using proactiv for about 2 years.  I dont have bad Acne, but I did tend to break out 2-3 times a month before I started useing proactiv.  I have always just washed my face with regular store bought acne wash, and it never seemed to help much.  PROACTIV is a great product, when all 3 main items (Face-Wash,Toner,Lotion) are used daily it is very effective in controlling break outs and the size of pimples.  I take showers at night, so I would keep the Face-Wash in the shower, after I shampoo I would wash my face...and it worked perfectly in the shower.  I would then apply some toner with a cotton ball after getting out of the shower.  Right before I go to bed, I would apply the Lotion (the Medication) which would take 30-45 sec. to dry.		I have been useing Proactiv for almost 2 years and my acne is almost always under control.  Even tho these 2 kits seem like alot of work, after you start seeing the big differnces in your skin after using them you wouldn't think twice about applying it every single night.  MY skin took about 2-3 weeks of getting use to the product before I started to see huge results and trust me I was happy with them.....very happy.		Proactiv Solution:	- Great Product, when used correctly and daily.	- I could see huge results after 2-3 weeks of use.	- Great for oily skin, not to harsh for my med type of skin.	- Expensive, 3 piece kit would cost about $45.00 and it would last about 4 months.		Klear Action Acne Treatment:	- Also a Great Product, same exact medications as Proactiv.	- Medications are the same, but Klear Action's Face wash has no micro scrubbers.  The toner is a differnt color and the Medication lotion is more watery.	- Bottles are not as nice as Proactiv, they tend to get ""Krusty Tops""	- I switched to this product for about a month already, and I have noticed no change in my complextion, and my acne is still under control!!!  GREAT PRODUCT!!	- At $20.00 shipped what better deal is out there.  Give it a try.  For new users I would give it about 2-3 weeks to see a differnce in your skin."
B0000AN9LA,2004,1,5.0,16,17,257,"Great Acne Treatment","This has been the best product for clear skin I've ever found.  I've used Clinique 3 step, Proactiv Treatment system, and even Alpha Hydroxy and prefer Klear Action,  because it's not too expensive and it keeps my skin clear around the clock.  I noticed a big difference after only the second week using this, but note that it will take about 5 - 6 weeks of continuous use to stay completely clear.  When I first started using Klear Action, I thought I wasn't going to like it. Comparing it to Proactiv (my favorite till I found this), I noticed the deep pore cleanser was a more diluted product and seemed to have less graininess for that bit of facial scrub consistency.  I also noticed a very small amount of graininess in the treatment lotion.  This ended up being no problem at all because, to me, Klear Action cleared my skin better than the proactiv.  The only drawback I would have in using this product is that it will discolor turtlenecks and other colored clothing that it comes in contact with (even after the lotion is dry on your skin), due to the peroxide in it (Proactiv does the same).  If I want to wear turtlenecks, I only wear white or off-white.  I actually have learned to stay away from mock-necks and turtlenecks almost altogether. :) It will also lighten hair it comes in contact with.  I still give this product 5 stars because completely clear skin makes the clothing issue and lighter hair such a trivial matter."
B0000AN9LA,2005,1,5.0,12,12,80,"Works as good as Proactiv but much cheaper","We highly recommend this product.  My son used Proactive for several months with good results but I saw a review for Klear Action and thought we would give it a try.  According to my son the Klear Action works just as good as the higher priced Proactiv.  My son is very conscious about his acne so if the Klear Action had not been working as well as Proactiv he would have refused to use it and would have gone back."

B0000AN9LA,2004,5,4.0,14,15,249,"Great Product, Great Price","I have had mild/moderate acne from age 11 to now in my mid-twenties.  I thought I would have grown out of it, but I have not.  I began using Klear Action 10 months ago and saw results w/in the first week.  It has not cleared my acne completely, but has improved it greatly minimizing breakouts, and making my skin soft and less embarrassing.  This product has been great for me and makes me feel better about my skin.  <p>My sibling suffers from worse acne and uses Proactiv with about the same results.  Klear Action is half the price and allows you to buy it one kit at a time, instead of ""joining a club"" and sending kits to you constantly.  In winter months my skin gets very dry so I only use Klear Action once a day with a good rich oil-free moisturizer w/ SPF.  In the summer months I use it twice a day with a light oil-free moisturizer w/ SPF.  A kit lasts me about 2-3 months.  Also, I use a sugar scrub once every other day before the cleanser to help remove dead skin.  Whether this helps the Klear Action work, I am not sure, but it makes my skin soft.<p>My only complaints about this product are that the Toner bottle, if tipped, LEAKS (so put it in another container or Ziploc if traveling), and that the products in the kit are not sold (to my knowledge) separately.  You have to buy a whole new kit."
B0000AN9LA,2005,0,3.0,17,19,271,"No miracle, but better than Pro Activ","I used Pro Activ for three years before giving up, as it just didn't do much for me.  I then tried something called Acne Free from University Medical Products, which was just terrible -- it was super-drying and the ""lotion"" was no lotion at all.  It actually gave me acne breakouts.  (Any class action lawyers here?)		Then I was browsing drugstore.com and saw this product called Klear Action.  Reviews were pretty positive, so I ordered a set from Amazon.  Compared to Pro Activ, the Klear Action (""KA"") cleanser is milky and much less abrasive.  I really liked it more than the Pro Activ (""PA"") cleanser.  The KA toner seems to be a little more stringent than the PA toner, but not unduly so on my skin which is a little bit more sensitive than the normal face (according to my dermatologist).  The KA repair lotion is more watery than the PA lotion, but it disappears once applied to the face, unlike the PA lotion which would stay visible for a few minutes.		So does this work?  I think it really depends on the person.  There are two aspects to consider here: 1) first, the KA set seems quite gentle so it should be okay for most face, and it seems to be working better than PA in getting rid of my acnes; however, it does not seem to be able to prevent pimples, which disappoints me; 2) second, pimples are like bacteria: after a while, they start resisting the treatment and will persist no matter what anti-acne product you use.		So far, Klear Action can keep my pimples under control.  [...]"

Definitely use a moisturizer with SPF if you're going out during the day and I recommend 3 times a day for the first few weeks. Now I just keep it up twice a day to make sure zits don't come back.

Start Klear Action once a day or longer with sensitive skin. I could finally use it twice a day. After a week it cleared up. A couple of weeks later I did it again. It got to be longer and longer between treatments. I could easily go a month or two before using another shorter treatment before it was discontinued. Why? Negative reviews. Always take negative or positive reviews with a grain of salt. Their are firms and individuals that can post thousands of reviews everywhere on the net.

It definitely dries out your skin a little bit, mostly because of the toner, so I use a couple of other products in conjunction with Klear Action to limit the dryness. After using the face wash and toner, I apply a small amount of Grapeseed Oil to my face. Grapeseed Oil is classified as an essential oil and is very light and won't clog your pores. It makes your skin feel very soft and I have almost zero dryness. After applying the Grapeseed Oil I apply the third step of Klear Action, the lotion. After letting that dry for a couple minutes, I apply my Oil of Olay Regenerist cream which is also very helpful with overall complexion, softness and eradicates dryness, as well.

I do suggest purchasing this product, however, I'd like to give a little warning to anyone who's interested. The company was nice enough to send a trial size version of their salicylic acid product along with this peel. They suggest using it a few days before doing the lactic acid peel, so that the l. peel works better. Well, my experience was not pretty...I did the s. peel about 4 days before the l. peel. I loved the outcome I got from the s. peel but once I did the l. peel I looked like I had burned my face off for about 3 days. I couldn't laugh, smile, make any facial expression whatsoever without pain. I'm not sure why I had such drastic results b/c according to the instructions that's exactly how they suggest using it. I only left the l. peel on for about 25 secs. This stuff is really strong so I would advise you not to use the s. peel first. Do one or the other and see how you react to it first. Then wait a lengthier amount of time in between both (definitely more than a week). All in all I was pleased with the results- it does do what it says it will but you have to be careful and check your skin sensitivity first.

After some experimenting though, I realized that for me the best combination was to use an over-the-counter microdermabrasion scrub beforehand, and then apply the peel with a fan brush from the craft store.

B000PNTQS4,2009,4,2.0,2,2,135,"What works for some, may not work for others","I hate to give this a low rating because i'm sure it worked for other people. It just wasnt right for me. I thought by getting 70% that id have a good enough strength to see some results, however...it didnt do anything. I felt like NOTHING was happening on my skin. I probably wouldnt get this if you're used to having things put on your skin...be it a peel or any other topical liquid or cream. I'm sure for those of you who dont exfoliate or, if you dont do much at all...this will be fine for you. I will say, though, that the people that work there were very helpful. They answered each question that I had within 24 hrs and always tried to help me further than I asked for. Great customer service!"
B000PNTQS4,2008,9,5.0,2,2,109,"Responsible seller","I bought this product with some trepidation as I heard of chemical peels gone bad on different television shows.  I have only used the lactic acid one time on my arms and have notice one scaly lesion starting to peel. I happened to not have any ill effects even though I left it on my arms for 3 hours.  This may be due to the thickness of my skin layers on my arms.	 One thing is that the seller of this product is more responsible than some of the other vendors. He included extensive directions on the use of the lactic acid unlike another vendor I had bought from."
B000PNTQS4,2011,5,5.0,4,5,288,"First time user with sensitive skin and acne--very happy!","My face has been through a lot this year.  In January I took advantage of one of those ""Groupon"" specials run by a local dermatologist's office for a Mixto laser treatment.  Unfortunately, this dermatologist didn't actually do the treatment--he had an assistant do it--unsupervised!  The results have been disastrous and I have spent a fortune on all kinds of products to try to get my skin back in order.  I've suffered (since the Mixto laser treatment) with uber-sensitive skin and awful acne. I'm 53 years of age and have never had such trouble in the past.  Anyway, I stumbled across the reviews for this product and ordered their lactic acid 70 percent, plus some glycolic and salycylic acid.  I started off using only the glycolic and salicylic, then last week I used the lactic acid and left it on for about 2 minutes.  At first, things actually seemed to get much worse.  I think I was stupid to start with such a high percentage on the lactic acid.  Anyway, I went to the health food store and bought pure shea butter for the dryness and flaking, and zinc cream for all of the bumps.  These two items saved the day.  I immediately began to heal and the acne started to subside, then some more little white things surfaced but came off quickly. I'm now about a week post-peel and my skin is starting to look rather amazing--clear, glowing, and even firmer.  I'm forcing myself to wait a while until my second peel and I will definitely dilute it the next time.  I plan to use these acid products from now on.  I couldn't be happier!  Be patient, be careful, follow the directions, and you will be very pleased!"
B000PNTQS4,2009,0,4.0,6,8,200,"Great So Far","So.... I received my Lactic Acid 70% and sample of Salycilic Acid fairly quickly even though Im serving in Iraq right now. The seller sent quite a few pamplets with direct instructions inside for each product which was great being that this was my 1st time using the peel. Me being anxious and all I did the Salycilic Acid which stayed on not even 2 minutes lol n about 4 hours later I did my Lactic 70% peel. I think the Salycilic acid burned the worse. After doing the peels I immediatly noticed softer skin, and of course redness. Im Caramel complexed, and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this product (LACTIC) for anyone lighter than me I WAS RED!! Only for about 20 minutes though. Anywho, I havent been drying up in the past 2 days since Ive done the peel due to the fact that I use St Ive's Moisturizing Cream (gentle), so now Im just waiting on the peeling whoooppeee right lol. Anyway as for the beginning stages this is a very good peel and for right now my skin is radiant even my battle buddies notice it. I will be sure to keep everybody posted throughout my process."

Not white as in pigment-less, but glowing like a pearl.  I've treated my mom, who is 80, and her skin improved 100%.  We've spent a lot of money on laser treatments, and lactic acid peel took the result to another level.  I want to tell everyone about it.  I tolerated the 70% just fine, so that I could use it every day for a week.  No burns, no irritation after I washed to tingling/itchy gel off.  Love the gel as it stays on the face without a drippy mess."

Good customer service! ;) I can't wait to use this peel again...oh and it's gel based....i used some sample ones from another company..and they were more watery...this one feels  thicker--which i like. It does sting..but i have a high tolerance for ""pain""...i left my 1st peel on for 6 min. They said you shouldn't leave it on for 10...which i'll probably shoot for next time...I did not peel what-so-ever. They told me...they make it that way...if you do peel...it wont be dramatic.

I have blotchy, freckly, acne scarred skin (not horrible, but could be better) and am looking for something to try before getting ""put under"" to do a serious peel.  I don't know that this will do anything for me since the Obaji did nothing at all. At any rate-just wanted to say that it doesn't BURN like a frying pan-like the Obaji did... Please ALSO know that after using both for some time-the GLYCOLIC acid works MUCH better if you have blotchy skin that needs improvement.

They are a good company, but this is a product review and the simple truth is that this peel is low quality. I've used lower stregth lactic acid in the past (from skin lab and other companies). This is very weak and not worth the time and money. Obviously skin sensitivity varies from one person to the next, so it might work better for others. But if you are an ""experienced"" peel user, and working up to stonger acids for more improvement I would advise you to look elsewhere."

This was my first peel, so I was extra careful. The first sample peel went fine. When I applied the lactic peel, it literally peeled my skin off. I was fortunate to apply to a small area. Lost 2 inches of my skin. I am brown in color. So area that got burnt is pale white and the rest of my skin in brown. Scary..I sent emails to these guys, got an auto response with no followup. If I were to use this product, would ensure its over a long holiday, so any burns, peels, hideous injuries, can heal itself without all the glare from people...The pain is unbearable even after you flush with water for ever...I would recommend, first time applicants to go to a salon and have it done and slowly work your way towards doing it yourself.

I haven't used the product yet (I'm waiting to get a facial at a spa first so my pores will be good and clean lol) but I have used 30% glycolic from June Jacobs. I was working at a spa at the time and received it as gratis during training. June Jacobs doesn't sell 30% glycolic to non professionals.

After six treatments over the course of two weeks, I began getting compliment about my skin. A complete stranger commented that my skin was flawless! A large brown age spot on my cheek started to fade immediately and after a month of using 3X/week, it's almost gone. I found using gauze wrap from a first aid kit to apply it allowed a mild pre-exfoiliation.  I found it easier to apply just before showering so that I could be assured it completely rinsed off.

This was my first purchase from Skin Laboratory & it wrecked my face completely. I only had it on less than 5 mins. I had scabs and burns all over my face for a week. BTW, I've been using Glycolic acid wash/moisturizer for years. I also had a professional Salicylic Acid peel and that also wrecked my face. I guess I just can't do anything besides Glycolic Acid. I've been using their GA peel 35% peel, after my face healed from the LA, with great results.  Regardless of the report that Lactic Acid is gentler than Glycolic, if you are not accustom to this type of acid or this level, be very cautious.  Also, a neutralizer is a must.  A Baking Soda solution works fine."
B000PNTQS4,2008,9,5.0,13,15,233,tyf,"I've been purchasing and using this product for several months now, and with great succuss: I offered communication to Skin Laboratory regarding	the pre/post preparation for optimalizing the benefits of this peel	product... The skin should be cleaned prior to applying the peel	(with nitrile or vinyl gloved hands) with DISTILLED water, and	it should be removed with DISTILLED or highly purified water	only (not just water straight out of the tap).	Skin Laboratory has no way of qualifying the immediate tap water supply	for any of the possible numbers (at different geographical locations)	of persons who might purchase this item: here at San Diego, the tap	water is suffering hard mineral elements of calcium, magnesium and	now 'flouride'... Whatever is traveling along with the water at	various locals could drastically reduce the results of the	lactic acid peel, or could cause an unhealthy or counter-	productive chemical mess on the surface of the epidermal.	It's not hard to heat some distilled water to pour into	a plastic bucket for setting into the shower area	moments before starting the peel application;	cold distilled water can also be set at	the removal area...	(I use the shower stall with the tap turned off: I repeatedly dip a steril cotton washcloth into the warmed distilled water for washing,	then dump the cold over my head and all, ""surfer"" style for a	thorough post application rinse.)"

I would only recommend leaving this peel on for 2 MINUTES. Anything over that is playing with fire.  It is strong and you need to make sure to remove all of the product once rinsing your face.  I would recommend, after using face wash to remove, a solution of ice water and baking soda to neutralize the acid, but all in all, I do like the product and the results are visible."
B000PNTQS4,2010,2,5.0,7,7,206,"No more acne breakouts!","My family and friends had been telling me that my breakouts were caused by me eating too much junk food, but after abstaining from it (I barely eat it anyway) for nearly two months, my face was still breaking out horribly, even with heavy water intake.  Eventually I just focused on getting rid of the scars, because that's what bothered me the most. I used the lactic acid 70% and actually kept it on a bit longer than recommended.  The strength wasn't enough the first time I used it and the second, so the next time I left it on until I felt it tingle (since it hadn't before).  My face never really peeled, but I could feel the difference immediately and saw the difference over the next few days.  It not only smoothed out my skin, but my breakouts were gone.  As a matter of fact, I've been drinking a coke a day now since my peel for about 3 weeks (just to prove my theory) and still no acne breakouts.  I've had a couple of pimples, don't get me wrong, but the dark rosy acne on both of my cheeks are gone. I'm an African American female, somewhere around Jill Scott's color. Great product!"
B000PNTQS4,2010,9,5.0,12,14,203,"Hands down winner!","I'm using this product on my hands.		When I noticed my hands were aging faster than the rest of me, I asked the dermatologist what I could do.  He told me to use a lotion called Lac-Hydrin, a lactic acid lotion.  I tried it and got no result; it is also thin and runny.  But I got the message that lactic acid is the thing to use on hands and body.		When I found this lactic peel, I thought maybe I could bring about improvement in my hands, bypassing the doctor.		I've been applying a nickel-size dollop of this lactic peel *every night* on my hands and forearms.  Once it's absorbed I put on a nice thick hand cream, and go to bed.		From the first morning, I have awakened with improvement in my skin.  My hands are less ""paper baggy,"" and the wrinkles are softening.  I'm thrilled and will continue with this routine until I'm satisfied with the result, and will use it periodically thereafter.		p.s.  If you have raggedy cuticles or open sores, take care. For me, the use of this peel is painless, but when I got it on a fresh cat scraatch, it was bothersome (for a short while)."
B000PNTQS4,2010,2,5.0,12,14,429,"Skin improved dramatically","I have been researching facial peels for 2 months, yes the thought of hearing the word CHEMICAL PEEL was frightening!! If you are allergic to milk or sour milk be CAUTIOUS, check with your dermatologist first. Just saying this as I have kids who are allergic to milk etc.  This is excellent for persons of African descent. I did a patch test on my inner arm and waited 48 hours and all was well.  I used this on March 3rd. I have finally tried lactic acid (70%) and my skin has improved dramatically! My larges pores have shrank somewhat! Company did recommend to leave the lactic on for exactly 5 minutes. I left it on for 8 minutes accidently, next time I will use timer,  it was my first time using it. I did felt a stinging as reported in the instructions included.  I have also been moisturizing at night with Almond oil and I am looking for a replacement. The result? Smooth textured clear, reduced pores and radiant skin! I can't wait to complete the process, because if this is what I achieve after just one treatment, my skin should be flawless by the time I'm done!! Needless to say I'm very optimistic and very, very pleased. This is for the doctors, who told me not to purchase the chemical peels based on these reviews.  She told me that she thought it was people who just made up reviews.  I am a REAL PERSON with real skin and I am sincere in my reviews to help others who are thinking of purchasing this product.

B000PNTQS4,2012,11,5.0,6,6,708,"It helped my stubborn, resistant hyper-pigmentation!","I started out with the 50% Lactic Acid peel, which helped fade my melasma a little, then I moved on to this one.		The first time I tried this peel, I started with a one minute application. I had mild tingling but nothing extreme.  I added 1 min each time until I was doing 4 minutes. I noticed more subtle improvements on my face each time and continued to be impressed with these peels. Lactic acid has a wonderfully moisturizing effect that leaves your skin so soft and smooth the next morning.		I've struggled with stubborn, resistant hyper-pigmentation (melasma) around my eyes for years. I tried countless products that seemed to work for others but did not work for me. Only photofacials had been able to remove it but it returned with the slightest bit of sun (hyper-active melanocytes) so photofacials were just too expensive for a temporary solution. These peels, week by week, (and a gradual increase in strength, along with a combination of other products I have listed on my profile), slowly faded them. As I moved on to stronger peels, its now 95% gone. It will still occasionally come back when I have a run in with the sun but it fades away again.		The company has a lot of information on their website and are very responsive so I continue to buy from them.		NOTES ON PEELS:	-Don't do it more often than they recommend.  They recommend you do it every so often for a reason. Your skin has to have time to heal and develop new skin before you strip it away again.	-You HAVE to wear sunblock. Your skin is more exposed and vulnerable to damage from sun. Protect it. If you don't you are canceling out or even reversing your progress. I like this one, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZF75LS"">Ole Henriksen Protect the Truth Sunscreen SPF 50+-1.7 oz</a>.  Its not the best moisturizer but as a sunblock, its great.  Its my favorite because its hard to find high spf that doesn't leave a white haze, smell funky or make your eyes tear up.	-When you are doing your peels, make sure you start with a clean DRY face, water will dilute the acid in your peel. I am wondering if thats why some people did not see any results.  I wash my face, swipe it with alcohol on a cotton ball to remove any leftover oils and to help dry it. Wait 10-15 minutes, then apply the peel.	-Use a fan brush like this one<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NMF63W"">Taklon Fan Mask Brush Acid Applicator for Glycolic Lactic TCA Skin Peel / Masques (Small)</a>. Mine has lasted over a year. You can use cotton balls/squares but I think they absorb product so you will waste some and get less peels out of your bottle.	-Watch your face when the peel is on.  The recommended time is a guideline, everyones skin is different and reacts differently. Thats why they recommend you start slow.  Some are ok 1 min the first time, others the full 4 min.  Once your skin starts looking pinkish, its time to remove. If it gets red, you've gone too long.	-Make sure you wash off ALL of the acid. Wash, rewash, wash again.  I like to shower right after to make sure its all gone.  Any leftover acid will continue to work its way into your skin. I like to use a post peel neutralizer as an extra precaution. MD Formulations had a post peel neutralizer that was AWESOME but they don't sell it individually. I am trying this one <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VEN3RW"">Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.</a>. It works but I am still trying to find one more like the MD formulations one.  You pour onto cotton ball and sweep your face right after peel, then wash it off with water. You can also mix your own neutralizer using baking soda and water.	-Moisturize after. This one has been my favorite to use after, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00700H128"">Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl(r) 3000, Argireline(r), Hyaluronic Acid & Natural Botanical Extracts</a>. I also use it as a night cream. Very moisturizing and doesn't feel greasy or leave a residue."

B000PNTQS4,2009,0,3.0,8,9,305,Eh...,"Decided to try this because I heard that Lactic Acid was supposed to be good for women of color.		My thoughts on this product: Eh....	It's ok...works alright.	I was surprised that it didn't do a whole lot. I figured ""What with this being 70%...""	>>shrug&lt;&lt;	I know that it's weaker than Glycolic but I expected something better. With glycolic the results are immediate for me, i.e, smooth texture, radiant appearance, improved clarity, gets rid of acne, etc...		But then again--I don't know the pH of this Lactic solution so I figure maybe it was kind of weak (i'm guessing).		I can see how it may work for others and for that reason I gave it 3 stars.  Maybe ppl with sensitive skin, or first-time users, etc... could get some use out of it.		Personally I prefer Glycolic Acid. Although I have been using a glycolic/lactic 35% combo (ph of 2.1) that came along with my kit (and found that to be quite effective), I may just go back to full Glycolic.		In any case, I have dry skin but I must exfoliate DAILY with a scrub (or I will break out) so I figure maybe this is the reason why the Lactic didn't meet my expectations.  I used to have my peels professionally done and my aesthetician used (glycolic) 40%-45%. I am 28 years old, btw and no I am a sporadic peeler so I haven't built up a resistance or anything like that.		UPDATE (24 jan):	This is pretty good. I received this in December and I wasn't impressed with it at first. But--I ran out of my salicylic and decided to try this again instead of the glycolic/lactic combo.	I figured, ""Well--I bought it...might as well try to use it.""	I wouldn't put this over glycolic but it did work very well."
B000PNTQS4,2008,5,4.0,5,5,49,"came quickly in mail","This was the first peel I bought. It came VERY fast. I have since ordered three other products from them and they all came quickly.  My skin has responded well to this.  I see a difference two days after. It saves me about 150 dollars a regular peel cost."
B000PNTQS4,2012,7,5.0,7,8,289,"OMG, I am 10 years younger!!!","I am so extremely excited, I am unsure of how to start...	I am 34 with a baby face, most people think I'm in my early 20's BUT up close have very, very deep lines around my eyes. Two deep crow's feet at each corner and then around the eyes LONG wrinkles reaching the middle of my cheeks. I do not smoke at all and have not smoked in the past. I have oily skin with larger than usual pores and occasional acne. I applied the peel, first time I could only bare it for about 20 seconds as there was a lot of stinging around my eyes. No improvement whatsoever though, just redness for about 2 hours. Next application was about 1 minute, still no difference but my skin was comfortable with the time amount. 3rd peel was about 4 minutes, some discomfort. Instant white bubbles all over face at contact with water+baking soda. Redness and lots of brown scabs around the eye area for about 5 days. Had to wear sunglasses, I looked like someone punched me in both eyes. Sand feeling all over my face, rough skin texture, looked terrible.	The skin sort of curled behind the scabs and I thought, oh no! SCARS!! After the scabs fell off I am a new person, a younger, prettier me. I feel SO MUCH better about myself as none of my friends have the amount of wrinkles around the eyes that I have. Now I have NONE. Pores are smaller than when I was 15. Overall evenness on the face. I am going to keep doing this another 3 times, then take a break for a couple of months. Then go back. This is a miracle! THANK YOU!"

It is good however for making the skin feel smooth and supple and it unclogs the pores. When I find something that actually does get rid of the hyperpigmentation I will use this to maintain the results but until then I need something strong...even at 70% it is EXTREMELY mild."
B000PNTQS4,2008,8,4.0,6,7,30,"Descent Product","I hoped the product would bring a quicker result. However, I am seeing changes of my blemishes fading the more I use the product.  Overall not too bad at all."

Occasionally I get a slight itch or tingle on my cheeks where my skin gets dry at times or on a pimple if I have one at the time. It's not bad at all just hard fighting the urge for scratch for those 3 minutes.

It really does sting upon application, though it doesn't cause a rash or irritate the skin after rinsing (copious, copious rinsing). I keep the timer next to me and count down the seconds until I can splash it off. I do find it does provide a good light peel, but I dread the sting so much I do not perform it as regularly as I should. I used to use an alcohol and glycolic acid liquid on my face at night, with a much lower acid content, but I worried the alcohol was hurting my skin. This stuff could hurt you if you don't prepare and handle it with respect.		Buy a dropper to measure the liquid with--you won't need very much each time. Buy a fan brush for application, and pour the liquid into a clean container that you can get the brush into easily for application and using all the product. HAVE A TIMER, and start at the shortest time of exposure and build up to longer times. Use sunscreen after or it's an entire waste.		It's a great thing to be able to do at home rather than have to pay expensive spa fees for."

I knew that Glyco-Lactic acid peels worked with my skin before buying this, as I'd seen dramatic improvements in scar removal, tightening, pore size, and tone from the spa.  What I didn't know was how easy it was to apply and remove the peel at home.  It was just as easy or easier than applying clay masks.  The money I am saving by buying this product is truly incredible, and another perk is that I have the ability to spot-treat.		One thing that wasn't clear before buying was how much of the bottle is used for a single application.  Suggested amount is 3 ml.  I used even less, so I'm looking at a good 12 treatments from this single bottle."

I got it with the intention of exfoliating a fairly new dark acne scar on my neck along with HQ 4% cream.  I have medium olive toned skin.  It didn't make it any better or worse but I have only used it 3 times so far.  It hasn't made any overall improvements in the rest of my skin either.

B000PNTQW0,2009,6,5.0,172,172,212,"quality product","I want to add to the reviews that I studied esthetics and carried a license as an esthetician for a period of time and I used peels and various glycolic and lactic acids on clients and for personal use.  I can attest to the quality of these.  I was weary at first because I have ordered on line in the past and ended up with something that just burnt the skin and did more damage than good.  There is a wide range of quality associated with these peels, and this product is one of the best.  There was a slight burn/tingling when I applied it, but it left the skin just ""sunkissed"" looking.  No peeling or down time involved...and it really did the job to remove the superficial layer of skin and create a healthy glow.  I would highly recommend this.  One last note...it is not recommended to apply peels in the summer months because removing layers of dead skin cells makes you much more vulnerable to damage from the sun.  Although I know better than to use it in mid-July as I have been...I am super careful to be sure to apply a minimum of 20 spf for every day and 40 spf and a hat on sunny days spent outdoors."
B000PNTQW0,2009,5,4.0,58,58,351,"So far, so good!!","This product arrived the next day , I was shocked how quick to came. I have mild sun damage, enlarged pores and have always had acne issues-blackheads on the nose, mild sebaceous cyst like, congested skin so my skin has mild scarring-texture and acne marks and oily skin, mostly t-zone area.	I have only used it twice, every 5 days, but have noticed an improvement in skin condition, texture is improving, my skin feels better, acne is alot better, minor wrinkles seem to be improving, acne scars look to be less, moisturizer seems to soak into my skin better not just ""sit "" on top anymore -skin seems more ""plump"",  haven't noticed much with the age spots/sun damage yet, but will see after a few more applications. I feel comfortable now going out without having putting on alot of makeup to cover those issues, just a little concealer & power and I'm good, no more heavy makeup base.	I was able to leave this on my skin starting at 3 minutes I am now up to 5, it does have a mild sting to it, didn't have much redness and what was there was better by morning. I did used a mix of about a tablespoon of baking soda in a cup of water for a neutralizer which did help, I splashed it on my skin after rinsing product off, left it sit for a minute or two then rinsed that off. My skin is sensitive to alot of products, but wasn't overly irritated by this, what I would say would be acceptable.  My skin didn't flake, appear overly dry or ""peel"" and I used the Dandelion moisturizer from Better Botanicals afterwards.	My skin is improving and hope the age spots start to fade a bit more. I would recommend this product, but everyone's skin is different, and do a test patch to figure out the tolerance for your skin.	Also I am a VERY picky on products I use for my skin, this so far is making a difference in the right direction and I will continue to use it!"
B000PNTQW0,2008,7,4.0,44,44,111,"does what it says","This product came with a small bottle of the salicylic acid peel, which i used beforehand. It was much stronger than this to me, but i dealt with it, plus it was nice that they included it in the package. I had yet to find something that would lighten the noticable dark places on my face but this has done it. i am in my early 40s and although my skin was not really bad, it has made a noticable difference, especially in the tone. it does tingle upon application but doesn't burn, and I had no peeling effect, but i am overall happy with it and will be ordering more."
B000PNTQW0,2008,10,5.0,35,35,299,YAY!,"I ordered this after reading about the benefits of glycolic and lactic acid peels. Ever since I turned 24 (I'm 25 now) my face just EXPLODED! I haven't had a clear, unzitty day so far! (And recently it's been getting worse)....		I read about how these acids help to ""Unglue"" the dead skin cells from your face so that the fresh skin cells can regenerate better and also the dead cells won't be able to clog up into pores (Which is one reason for acne)..... The minute I read this I had to try a peel and see if it would help me skin!		I put it on last night, only kept it on for 2 minutes and then rinsed it off thoroughly. I also bought the pH balancer to use as an after treatment. SO far my skin FEELS so soft and LOOKS a LOT smoother. I'm waiting for the remaining spots I have on my face to heal up and then in the next week or so I will let you know if this helps keep new breakouts at bay by keeping my face regenerating........ I HOPE THIS WORKS!		EDIT: It is now 01/14/09 and WOW! What a difference! At first I used this peel once a week for about a month and MAN! It makes your skin so smooth and soft. After about two weeks I noticed I had not had ONE cystic zit! NONE! (I was still getting littler ones here and there but they were NOTHING compared to the big painful cystic zits I would normally get!) And now, two months later and my face is almost completely clear. I get about one zit a week, and it goes away FAST! I am so happy I found something that helped my acne prone skin!"
B000PNTQW0,2011,1,4.0,28,28,489,"Gentle, yet effective","I am a cosmetologist, am fairly well trained in skin care, and have used several different peels in the past. This peel was gentle on my skin, though it definitely ""tingled"" while it was on my face. At first I actually thought it didn't work because my face wasn't red after, and I only experienced a mild flaking after a few days, but after 3 applications, my pores are noticably smaller, my skin looks brighter and fresher (which is saying something since it's winter and my skin generally looks very dull with all the dry air) and the majority of my black heads and blemishes are gone!	I originally decided to use the peel because as a 26 year old with moderate acne I have used virtually every skin care regimen and found them all to be very harsh and drying on my already dry skin. However, because this peel contains lactic acid as well as glycolic acid, it addresses not only my immediate problems with spots and blemishes, but also the underlying causes like enlarged pores, and overly dry skin.	Overall, this is a great product, but I'm only giving it 4 stars because this is very gentle for a stage 2 peel. I was expecting it to have a bit more ""muscle"" behind it to help facilitate the speedy fading of some older blemish scars.	Tips:	Be prepared to neutralize (I used the neutralizing pads from the Boots No. 7 glycolic peel system, baking soda + water works well but will be gritty so apply gently, or copious amounts of plain water- and I do mean copious)		Moisturize- have a gentle, non comodogenic moisturizer on hand (this means it wont clog those pores you just worked so hard on!)and make sure it isnt oily or greasy. The name for the oil that your skin produces is called sebum, and that's what gets blocked up to create pimples and black heads. Oil found in moisturizers can do the same thing.		Sunblock- Your skin will be more sensitive to sunlight. Even use it on overcast days because uv rays can reach through clouds even though light rays can't. You should be doing this already though to avoid skin cancer, wrinkles and age spots!	I know all these have been mentioned in other reviews, but they can't be stressed enough!		And people, this is an acid peel. It's not a toy. Use some common sense and don't use just before a big event or a special occasion. It's called a ""peel"" because it causes the top layer of your skin (the epidermis, made up of dead skin cells) to ""peel"" off and reveals the underlying layer (dermis, fresh, new skin cells) which is sensitive to begin with and has now been treated with a fairly harsh acid. You may (read: probably will) have red skin for a day or so and it may (read: probably will) be a bit tender."
B000PNTQW0,2009,4,5.0,24,24,178,"works well","I was a bit hesitant to buy this, as you never know what exactly it is you're going to get.	 I recieved the product in a very timely matter, and after reading the detailed instructions and warnings, was a bit reluctant to use.(the instructions are very complete and leave nothing to question)	  However I went ahead and tried it.	 After the first application I was surprised to see how well it did work.  I used it only one minute the first several times, and have gradually worked up to only 3 minutes on my face.	  Even these short lengths of time have made a remarkable difference to my face. I have a problem with aging skin and lots of recurrent milia. Which nothing has touched. These were immediatly reduced in size and after several ""peels"" have disappeared.	 My derma doc was surprised that we could, as lay people buy such a high concentration and quality on line.	 I will continue to buy and use this product on my face forever!  The results are nothing short of amazing!	scat"
B000PNTQW0,2009,7,3.0,32,34,79,"Works... (to a point)","I'm of mixed/multi-racial heritage (mainly black/white), hence I have a medium brown complexion, nevertheless, it works rather well.	Helps to fade dark spots to a certain degree, i.e. they're a lot lighter than they were, and perhaps not as noticeable.		It also makes for a good, overall light facial peel.		Addendum :	I have since tried the Lactic Acid 70% Gel Peel, 100ml (re: http://www.amazon.com/Lactic-Acid-Peel-100ml-Professional/dp/B001THX07S/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top )  - And find this works much better, even if over a longer period!"
B000PNTQW0,2010,7,4.0,18,18,419,"A peel one can use weekly for maintenance...","I purchased this peel because I wanted something that might help to fade any small freckles/sun spots developing on my face, as well as fade small wrinkles near my eyes. I am Asian, with a medium-light complexion that is already fairly wrinkle and acne-free; but I was starting to see more melanin spots on my face developing, as I didn't start using sunscreen on my face daily until age 30 (I am now 35). However, my skin does tend to be oily in the T-zone, and I would still get an occasional pimple on my forehead or under my cheekbones on a regular basis.		After using this product, I noticed that my already scarce breakouts became practically non-existent, and though some of the small freckles on my upper cheeks haven't faded much, my skin does feel and look smoother and clearer. I don't use concealer, powder, or foundation (I can't stand the look and feel of it on my skin), and only use Shiseido SPF 55 for the face on a daily basis, but this seems to be all I need to still look pretty flawless, which I attribute to some of the peel's effects. I originally only used the 35% glycolic acid peel sold by the same company, but decided to try this lactic acid/glycolic acid combination to see if it would have a different or stronger effect (it does sting/tingle more than the 35% glycolic acid peel alone). I usually use this product every 7 days, and leave the solution on for a full 10 minutes (it stings and tingles, but this doesn't bother me much; leaving it on this long doesn't cause any ""hot spots"" on my skin, either, but my skin is pretty resistant to a lot of environmental insults). I also notice that small blackheads and sebaceous plugs in my forehead and nose will loosen easily and can be pushed or exfoliated out more easily after using this peel.		Overall, I think this is a good maintenance peel for those who want to slow (or possibly even reverse) the subtle signs of aging, i.e. development of melanin pigmentation from sun exposure, smoothing the surface of the epidermis, possibly neutralizing fine lines, and decreasing acne. I will likely continue using this product, until I become adventurous enough to perhaps try something different and stronger (i.e. a 70% Lactic Acid peel). The price is right, too, and won't cost you the overhead you might pay for having the same type of peel done at a medi-spa."
B000PNTQW0,2011,4,5.0,17,17,289,"dewy, clear skin","I moved up to this level 2 peel after about a year of doing less intense home peels with products from the same company.  As always, the quality of product is excellent.		I use the peel twice a week during fall, winter and spring months.  In the summer, I avoid these peels, unless I know I will be out of the sun for 2 weeks at a time.  First, I clean my face thoroughly with my Clarisonic, which I have found gets my skin cleaner than anything.  I dry my face thoroughly, and apply a thin layer of the gel peel, which I let sit for between 5 and 7 minutes.		 Yes, it stings.  Not unbearably, and it diminishes as the peel begins to work.		When the time is up, I rinse my face (usually I've been in the bathtub, shaving legs or whatnot) in the shower with lukewarm water.  I do a quick pat dry with a towel, leaving my face damp, and then immediately apply moisturizer.  I've found that Cetaphil cream and a drop of matrixyl oil, which contains glycerin, make the perfect ultra-rich and irritant-free moisturizer, which soaks right in to the skin after a peel.  It's soothing and those peptides get right where they need to go this way.		I am 50 years old, and I've been doing this routine, with variations, for a few years.  I have minimal crows feet and no other fine lines or wrinkles.  My skin is clear, glowing, and healthy-looking.  I had adult acne well into my  forties, but between Bare Minerals makeup and the peels, that's a thing of the past.  Even the little whiteheads and tiny bumps I used to get around my jaw or hairline are gone."
B000PNTQW0,2008,4,5.0,16,16,82,"Something that TRULY works.","I was really excited when i found a dermatologist strenght product for my skin. I have had acne for a long time and it hasn't been bad for a while, but recently i have had some breakouts and i wanted something that was going to control my acne. This product works very well. I am very reluctant to buy acne products because so many in that past have failed. I loved this product and would recomend it for anybody with skin problems."
B000PNTQW0,2012,1,5.0,3,3,148,"Works for tone and quality - not wrinkles","While I bought this to help the wrinkles developing under my eyes (grad school) and it hasn't, I'm still giving it five stars because the quality of my skin has improved dramatically. I have always had problem skin, haven't been out of the house without makeup on in a very long time. I've been using this product once a week for about six weeks now, and last week I noticed my skin is incredibly clear and smooth. I really recommend it for that reason alone. It's also MUCH more mild than some other peels and doesn't cause your face to peel excessively. I've used the strong salicylic acid peel and it just isn't practical to use if you have a job and don't want people to see your face peeling off in sheets. This peel produces better results without the pain and hassle of a prolonged peel. Great!"

B000PNTQW0,2011,7,5.0,3,3,214,"Finally... Something that works!","I purchased this item a few weeks ago, and since then I have used the product 3 times. The first time I was a little bit scared that I was going to burn my skin, so I only left it on for two minutes. I'll be upping my time to about 4 minutes next time around. I am in my late twenties, and I have acne scars, as well as current acne to battle. I also have very large pores around my nose and cheeks. I am seeing a difference in the clarity and notice my skin getting softer. My pores also seem to be cleaner, and less prominent. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with the same skin issues. You will definitely feel the tingling, but nothing unbearable. But you will more than likely start seeing a difference in your skin pretty immediately. I also cleanse with a mixture of water and baking soda to balance the pH after washing with plenty of water. I am currently using this product every 5 days.		I hope that this product continues to work, as it has for my sister who is 3 years older with the same problem skin. Her skin looks great!!!

I swabbed some on with cotton gauze, left it on for about 5 minutes and rinsed my skin for a few minutes with cold water before splashing a mixture of cold water and baking soda (prepared beforehand) on my face. I left this on for a minute and then rinsed. I felt very minimal stinging while using the peel and almost none after the baking soda and rinse. I did the full 6 treatments spaced 4 to 7 days apart. I had no visible peeling or flakiness, but my skin became clearer, softer and more even-toned every time I did the treatment. It's been about a month and a half since my last treatment and to my surprise my skin has stayed almost completely clear. Even my usual hormonal and stress breakouts only produced a couple tiny blemishes that disappeared quickly on their own. I have spent twice as much on glycolic acid products that irritated my skin and didn't produce a quarter of the benefits of this product. This stuff is amazing!!!

B000PNTQW0,2010,4,3.0,3,3,449,"Results probably depend on your skin sensitivity...","I have mostly oily skin, so really no wrinkles as I've had a ""natural"" moisturizer my whole life.  I'm 35 and while my skin isn't wrinkled, I've noticed some age spot/discoloration to my forehead and nose in the past 2 years.  It's not super dark but pretty bothersome for me.  I've also noticed my cheeks seeming a bit reddish in the past year so wanted something mainly to even out my skin tone.  I also read that this product could help with some blackheads that I've always had on my nose.  I tried this product out, first on the back of my hand and a small patch on my arm and right away noticed I didn't feel any sting.  Which I figured was good but also made me question whether or not it would work for me.  After a few days, I saw no reaction, adverse or otherwise, so I did a whole face application.  This time, I did feel some slight stinging but nothing unbearable.  I should note that I don't consider my skin to be sensitive and so wasn't really surprised by this.  Because of the lack of stinging, I kept it on for about 5 mins.  I saw no results after this 1st app, so I went ahead and a few days later did a 2nd app - it felt about the same but this time I kept it on longer - maybe 7 mins.  Still no real results.  I did see a tiny bit of peeling around the crease of my nose, but that's it.  My 3rd app I decided to keep on for the max of 10 mins and even did my chest area, as it's seen some sun over the years too.  Again, same feeling but no real results, EXCEPT that I seemed to be getting acne, AKA, whiteheads, on my chin and lower cheeks.  NOT what I was hoping for, as far as results!  In the end, I believe this product will possibly work for someone with skin not as ""tough"" as mine, if that makes sense.  I didn't love the pimples I got after using this but they weren't terrible.  That was the worst side effect so I can't really say too many bad things about this product.  In the end, I think I may need a stronger peel to see results.		Just to note, I found the product to feel good going on, as in, it's consistency is smooth and easy to apply and noticed no real scent.  This bottle would last me a long time if I continue to use it.  For now, I think I might try the HQ or some other level 3 peel from this company."

I started tanning when i was 16 and will never go again and I am now 22.		Anyways, I break out occaisionally and had more of a problem with the tiny little break out guys that made my skin bumpy and just wouldnt go away. I had started getting microdermabrasion but i had found that it was making my skin feel smoother but not really having a effect on any scarring spots like i had wanted.		I started researching and read that peels do a good job resurfacing skin and diminishing any hyperpigmentation or acre scarring so I bought the Walgreens brand of a glycolic acid cream that is 12% strength and i love that for daily use but it is now discontinued :(		The cream was making me breakout much less but still not having much of an effect on the scarring and dark spots - and by this time i was the palest i've seen myself in years from not tanning anymore so it just was noticable to me		So i finally bought this peel, and for the first round of uses I used it 4 times, a week a part. I actually would experience some peeling, along my mouth and around my nose, plus it was winter so my skin was dry. It made my face look kind of beat up and red for a couple days, expecially around my mouth where i have the most darkening, but this is also the area that was peeling the most so it was good :).		I would leave it on for as long as i could stand it, probably at most 3-4 minutes, it stung my face kind of bad its like an annoying pain.		Im at the end of the second round of uses. I probably waited around 5 weeks before starting up again because i wasnt sure if I would go on spring break or anything and be in the sun, but i decided not to and keep staying out of the sun and go for another round.		This time I have been using for about 6 weeks, a week apart, and this time around it is really doing justice on my face. The texture of my skin is much much smoother, and the spots keep on lightening. It helps with my breakouts also, the small little guys never come and I will get a few here and there around my period or whatever.		I also wash my face with Olay's regenerist daily peel that has glycol in it also, and when it is on my face i have been rubbing in some cleanser with saclyric acid also, mine is Clinque's Emergency Mask, but I just use it to supplement my regular cleaser.		For moisturizer I have been using lately the past couple weeks, Ambi Fade Cream, that has sunblock and I think that has been really helping the spots along with the peel, the peel probably helps it sink in good.		Its getting close to summer now so I have to transition away from this peel and to things that arn't going to make my face sensitive. I will continue using the Ambi Fade Cream, Washing with the Clinique Mask, and start bringing in Walgreen's new cream, its a day cream that has all the right ingredients, some glycols but its a day cream so itll be ok to use as long as I wear sunblock all the time. For Sunblock i am using Aveeno Ageless Vitallity Spf 50, this is also supposed to work well with anti-aging, spots, ect.		I will however use this peel for the rest of my life every winter. My skin hasnt look so good since i was in highschool with its tone, color, and texture. It looks great! definatly use this product but only in the winter! If you use this product and at the same time go outside and tan you will probably do more damage then what could have been fixed."

I am going to complete the 6 peels, and rest for a couple of months before re-starting.  Also, the bottle is still 3/4 full.	I would recommend it."
B000PNTQW0,2012,8,5.0,2,2,303,"Whoa!! Impressed...","I am a 31 year old female with acne on my chin; I wake up pretty much every morning with a new pimple and if I don't have one in the morning then I can certainly count on having one by the end of the day. I also have scarring from having acne on my chin since I was 14 and scarring on the sides of my face. My skin is very oily and sensitive at the same time. I have tried absolutely every kind of foundation and every single one breaks me out. Hence, I'm not left with much to cover the mess on my face. Proactiv keeps it under control, but doesn't solve the problem completely.		I've use some Glycolic peels in the past, with decent results...but this one really delivered. Tried it for the first time last night and my skin is glowing today...less oily and my pores look smaller too. I also had one of those huge, painful pimples forming under my skin and when I got up this morning, it was as if it was already clearing/drying out. I usually need to blot the oil off of my face at least 3 times per day and only had to once today and that's because I was outside in the humidity.		I didn't find the stinging to be bothersome; to me it felt as if my pores were being cleansed from the inside out. My face felt so clean afterwards. I was able to tolerate the full 8 minutes the first time, as was my skin...but I am also someone who has done chemical peels before and I'm very into skincare and makeup products, so I've just tried many products on my face overall. Of all those products, this is the second one I've written a great review of."
B000PNTQW0,2012,4,5.0,2,2,37,"Great product.","This product really does what it is intended to do. It's a bit stronger than the Level 1 Glycolic 35, so I would only leave it on for 5 minutes or less unless you can tolerate it."

B000PNTQW0,2012,1,5.0,3,5,307,"Great peel","I suffer from eczema on my limbs and torso and severe dryness on my face.  All my skin problems are fairly new, and I have been searching for a product or regime that will ease the uncomfortable and sometimes painful dryness I experience on my face.  Initially, I stopped cleansing my face with my normal face wash and decreased my cleansings to once at night.  I began using Josie Maran's argan oil cleanser which did not seem to help.  Then I tried the oil cleansing method- a mixture of caster oil and apricot kernal oil- to clean my facial skin.  This method relieved some of the irritation,  but my skin was still extremely dry even after applying a generous amount of moisturizer (Dr. Grandel PhytoCare AZULENE CREME).  My next try was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PNTQW0"">Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel -30 ml/1 fl oz</a> which did not seem to help but actually make my skin worse.  After my second use of the chemical peel, I started using this Emu Oil.  The emu oil has no scent and absorbs into the skin better than other oils I have tried. It has been the only moisturizer that has kept my face from having that tight feeling for nearly the entire day.  After the second application of the chemical peel and the daily use of the emu oil for less than a week, I have seen a dramatic difference in my skin.  The peel helped remove the patchy, red dry skin and the emu oil has made my skin feel fabulous for the first time in months.  My skin is so soft and smooth, it's incredible.  I would recommend the use of both <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PNTQW0"">Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel -30 ml/1 fl oz</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWV40U"">Emu Oil Pure Premium Australian - Powerful Skin and Hair Moisturizer</a> to anyone suffering from extremly dry skin."
B000PNTQW0,2012,9,3.0,1,2,445,"Unsure of how I feel about this product","I am 31 years old with what I would consider to be average to above average skin, sometimes a little dry in places but with very few blemishes, no visible wrinkles- I'm often mistaken for being 10 years younger. I am allergic to almost all sunscreens, but have (thankfully) recently found sunscreen that contains titanium oxide doesn't make me break out. Unfortunately I have some freckling and sun damage from childhood summers spent in the sun (without sunscreen) and have been looking for an economical way to get rid of that damage.  After reading reviews on this product I decided to buy a bottle of Glyco-Lac 60 and give it a try. I have previously used glycolic skin pads so skipped right to the level 2.  On my first application of the gel I was able to leave it on for about 90 seconds, after reading reviews I didn't want to leave it on too long.  I followed the instructions not to peel or pick or do anything to my face for 4 days... nothing. My skin still looked the same normal dull that it looks when it really needs to be exfoliated. Finally on the fourth day I decided to exfoliate with some baking soda since it is gentle and the least abrasive thing I could use.  I couldn't really tell any difference afterward other than my face being normal looking after an exfoliation, no amazing stunning results to be found.  10 days after my initial peel I decided to give it another try- I wasn't expecting miracles and realize that things don't always happen overnight.  Second application I applied and left on for 3 minutes, and again waited with the same results as before. No visible skin improvement at all, which is a little bit disappointing.  On the 5th day I decided to use a new product that a friend told me about which is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XKY70"">BeautiControl BC Spa Resurface Multi-Acid Resurfacing Peel</a>  I used the Beauticontrol peel pad to wipe my face in a circular pattern, which I could ""feel"" scrubbing (more so than just a normal face pad). I left the product on my skin for 20 minutes which is the maximum recommended time and when I rinsed my face I could immediately tell that my face was softer and smoother. I was absolutely amazed.  Is it possible that the previous 2 weeks of glycolic acid peel had ""prepared"" my face for the other peel? Maybe, and I will definitely continue to use the glyco-lac peel gel that I bought until it is gone but the Beauticontrol will be my ""go to"" for peeling and refreshing and fingers crossed, reducing discoloration."
B000PNTQW0,2012,7,3.0,1,2,61,Ouchies,"This stuff worked the first couple times I used it but I made the mistake of leaving it on 7 minutes (it says up to 8) and it burnt my face really badly. It is excellent for spot treatment but it is extremely harsh for my sensitive combination skin and I would definitely recommend starting off with a less abrasive peel."
B000PNTQW0,2011,8,5.0,1,2,143,"Right on!!!","Ok, so Im 37, and started to get the large pores and fine lines... I used it four times, once every five days. My friend said my skin looked like it had been raised in a petre dish with no stress. My skin is super soft, pores are smaller, lines are diminishing. First time I used it, my skin was soft, that was about it. I didn't start seeing results intil the fourth time, real results, that other people see. So hang in there, and keep up with the once every five day treatment. It burns a lot if you do some microdermabrasion before putting on the peel, and will also itch a burn, but this only seems to last about 5 seconds, then chills out. My husband started using it on his tattoo and it is lighting up his tattoo as well."
B000PNTQW0,2011,4,4.0,1,2,104,"Good product","I bought this chemical peel to fade my sun spots.  It didn't quite happen all the way, but I still like the product.  It makes my skin look younger and my pores smaller.  Just be really careful!!!  I burned my face a couple of times for leaving it on too long. The burns weren't noticeable and scabbed away quickly, but it's still better to use precaution.  I don't recommend doing your entire face on the first try because if you are too sensitive to it you'll be really screwed.		Overall, I like it.  Once the bottle runs out I will buy a higher concentration."
B000PNTQW0,2010,8,5.0,1,2,150,"It works!","I read all the reviews on various peels and decided to try this one. I have large pores and recently started getting light (very light) discolorations on my forehead. I have used this 3 times now - once a week - and there is a huge difference in the size of my pores! They are much smaller and some you can barely even see. The discolored spots are almost gone as well. I am very impressed and look forward to each application to see the improvements. It did sting a little at first just along my cheek bones so I only left it on for about 1 1/2 minutes. I am up to 5 minutes now with very little sting. I haven't had any actual ""peeling"" and I do use a moisturizer after treatment so my skin doesn't dry out.	I will try to follow-up in a couple more weeks."
B000PNTQW0,2011,9,1.0,4,7,426,"Made me break out in huge swollen bumps!","I've been using a light glycolic acid peel for years with great results. For the last 6 months I've been using the ""Aqua Glycolic"" skin care line, which includes a face wash, toner, face cream, body wash and body cream. I used to have really bad cystic acne along my jawline, but Aqua Glycolic products changed my life. I don't use all of their products every day anymore, but I use at least the face cream once every 3 days to keep up my smooth clear skin.		My skin has been really great, but since I'm getting married late October, I thought it would be great to try a stronger peel. I want to look my best for my wedding day and since I've had great results with glycolic acid in general, Glyco-Lac/60 seemed to be the next logical step.		WRONG! I kept it on for about 1 minute and rinsed it off with tons of water in the shower. My face felt a little sensitive, but no big deal. Within 5 hours, I could feel a whole crop of pimples developing along my jawline. Since I haven't had any breakouts for over 6 months, this was quite surprising. By the next morning, my entire jawline was covered with huge cystic swollen acne.		It's been 4 days and I'm getting even more acne. I don't know what to do because my wedding is 21 days away! I need this to go away quick. I'm so surprised because I'm no stranger to glycolic acid and I only left it on for 1 minute. Also, since I've had such good experience with glycolic acid in the past, I couldn't imagine this happening. Could it be purging my skin of any leftover stuff in my pores? That would be ok, but I hope it finishes the process sooner than later. I guess I'm wearing my hair down for the wedding!		I read and followed all the instructions, but everyone is different. I even did a patch test on the inside of my arm. I nearly covered from wrist to bicep and left it on for 1-2 minutes. My arm is just fine and nothing happened whatsoever, so I proceeded to apply it to my face.		I'm glad to hear that most everyone else had a great experience. I just wanted to share a different type of experience with those who may be sensitive to this product. I should have left well enough alone!

B000PNTQW0,2010,3,5.0,6,7,757,"Nice Lite Peel","Nice lite peel.  I'm 37 and have had acne since age 9 and still do.  I have been a smoker for 18 years (quit 3 months ago-wish me luck), so obviously this has taken a toll on my skin.  I have been using Retin-A since I was 16 years old. I have dark marks where previous acne has been.  I have a few tiny dent-type scars that blend into my smile lines mostly.  I also developed ""melasma"" 3 years ago...SUDDENLY when I was on a Caribbean cruise (obviously in the sun).  Even though I had been using VERY high SPF and very water/sweat proof, on my face for many years...and was wearing it FULL TIME on this trip...it still appeared and never went away.  It is less noticeable when I haven't been in the sun for a very long time (winter time), but even with high SPF it still appears MUCH DARKER as soon as the sun hits my face and doesn't go away at all during summer months.  I also have had very dark circles under my eyes for many years due to my olive skin complexion.  I also have had redness around my nostrils and on my chin for the past 7 years.  7 years ago a derm told me that the red stuff was also sun damage (I was expecting a rosacia diagnosis). I have also had large pores for a long time especially on my nose and chin...but they all look big to me. I also still have an oily T-zone.		Ever since I developed the melasma 3 years ago I have been searching for a cure that I could afford but I never found anything.  My wrinkles and acne I have learned to live with...not happily but as a matter of nature.  After researching I knew that the only fixes would be expensive salon or derm procedures.  So I gave up and tried to embrace my new marks all over my face...(ARE YOU KIDDING?).  I have not been able to do this so THANK GOD I RAN INTO THE REVIEWS OF THESE PRODUCTS ON AMAZON!!!  I'm SOOOOO EXCITED!!!		I purchased this peel, the 20% Salicylic Acid peel, the HQ+ (to use in the future - once I have a tolerance to peels), and the pH balancer.  The balancer is worth the 10 bucks!!!  I did buy all but the ph balancer [...] because it was a tiny bit cheaper and I like the applicator gauze that they sell which I couldn't find on Amazon.  It is only 6 bucks for 200 and they are perfect for this use! More sanitary than using a brush over and over also.  They are not very absorbent so you don't feel like the gauze is sucking up/wasting the product.		5 days ago I got the purchase in the mail. I used the Salicylic first because it was a Saturday and I therefore knew I would have a little healing time, if needed. The Salicylic was stronger. Today is Sunday (a week later) and I just used THIS peel.  I was able to leave this one on for about 5 minutes. From my experience last week, the creases around my nostrils ARE VERY SENSITIVE so I applied to that area after doing the rest of my face. On that area I was only able to leave on for about 1.5 minutes.  On my face I felt like I could have left it on longer but didn't since it was my first time using it.  Both masks make pores smaller IMMEDIATELY!  Especially the biggest ones so THAT IS AWESOME!!!  My skin feels and looks very smooth, clean, brighter and tighter than prior to using.  I can't wait to work my way up to the HQ+ since that is the one that is for ""dark marks"".  Both this peel and the Salicylic made my darker areas of my face look a tiny bit brighter (including the redness, scaring, under eye circles and the melasma).  This shocked me in a wonderful way, because neither of these peels are supposed to improve these things specifically. I had a mild breakout on my chin and forehead after the first peel in areas I always have acne (about 3 days after using the peel) therefore I'm assuming that it was acne already underlying my skin that the peel ""brought out"".  I'm used to this when ever I restart Retin-A so I'm not worried about it continuing.		I'll post an update in a month or so.  Happy peeling!!!!  Read the directions and don't worry!!!"

The other blemish has also diminished significantly.  I will continue to report my experience with this product, but so far I am impressed.		Update [1/12/10]: I developed a pimple on my nose yesterday.  I applied the peel as a spot treatment this morning.  By tonight, the whitehead flaked off my nose and left behind only a small red area, whereas normally I have to pop my pimples.  To add more background... I have been plagued for years with tenacious pimples that wouldn't go away unless I squeezed them.  Lately I have been religiously using salicylic acid wipes/washes and hyaluronic acid moisturizer--which significantly reduced my breakouts--and I think this glycolac peel was the missing ingredient.

As a frame of reference, I have used AHA/BHA/Salicylic products in the past, like the Alpha-Hydrox 12% souffle, a 15% Glycolic mask, as well as a home microdermabrasion buffer (Olay) and a microdermabrasion cloth, the kind used in plastic surgeon's offices. All have given good results, but some better than others (see later in review).		So I had all my treatment tools ready--a clock with a ""second"" hand to count the seconds, the baking soda and cool water mix, the gauze pads, a sink full of cool, running water, a shower, and witch hazel astringent.  The witch hazel is suggested as a pre-treatment to remove surface oil from the skin.		I pulled back my hair and pre-treated with witch hazel.  I poured the solution into a flat dish, dabbed the pad in, and started at forehead as suggested, went to one cheek, then onto the other, finishing with the chin and jawline.  All this time I kept a sharp watch on the clock and monitored my tingling tolerance.		At one minute, my forehead felt nothing, but my cheeks and chin, as well as nose, were really feeling the pain.  So I began rinsing those quickly, and at 1 min 30 secs the forehead was hurting a lot so I rinsed that, and continued thorough rinsing, then went to the water/baking soda mix, splashed that on for about 10 seconds, then I  popped into the lukewarm shower.  My facial skin felt really dry in the shower (do not use any cleansers!)  After that was done I moisturized.  It is now 30 minutes later and my skin definitely looks better, smoother, more even-toned. It does still sting a bit, like that sunburn feeling, though, and shows a light pink tinge.		In terms of intensity, it is slightly stronger to the results I had with the microdermabrasion cloth and 15% mask, and even more intense than the 12% souffle, and much more intense than the Olay microdermabrasion puff.		I am really surprised that it took only 1 minute to start to feel such strong tingling, considering I do not have sensitive skin.  This product does work, so I suggest monitoring intensity closely, especially the first time.  Also, if you pre-treat with witch hazel or alcohol (even stronger), both of which strip surface oils from your skin, then it will definitely affect (shorten) the time it takes for the product to work.		Okay, 45 minutes later, as it took time to write and proof this review, and the stinging has pretty much gone away, as has the pink tinge, although my face still feels dry and tight.		I cannot imagine increasing the strength of this product; I would rather leave it on longer and monitor the time.  My friend has had acid peels in a surgeon's office twice, and although the peels have gone deep and been quite effective in dealing with wrinkles, boot have left her with white splotches (uneven pigmented areas) that I, personally, would prefer to not have, at the cost of doing a lighter peel such as this, and tolerate a few more wrinkles."
B000PNTQW0,2012,6,4.0,3,3,278,"Overall good product","Having tried TCA in the past and been burned pretty bad, I decided to try several steps lower. This product is overall way better for someone newer to chemical peels. I am bi-racial with medium brown, moderately oily skin. I have some minor scarring from acne that ended around 7 years ago.		I agree with some users on some complaint. For my first use, I ensure the areas it would be applied to had not been tweezed/shaved/exfoliated 3 days prior (I believe the instructions recommends 24 hr). My skin got red in some areas of my skin that had negligible irritation until the acid was applied. My first application and some of my subsequent applications caused me to have minor break outs, made up of 4-5 small, rash-like pimples. The worst I have had is 2-3 areas of localized outbreak. It is almost always on my lower cheek/jawline and/or chin. It is really unpredictable whether I will see an outbreak or not, as I've done it with no outbreak several time. This is an acid... I would not put it on my face right before picture day"". I also find that when I have accidently scratched an area that was in the pre-peeling stage, it would be slightly hyperpigmented compared to the rest of my skin.		My pores are far more refined, and the acne scars cannot be seen unless looking closely and carefully if I'm wearing a concealer. Other than the discoloration from scratching, which I was able to get rid of in 4 peels, this is a fairly good product. Wear sunscreen, try not to scratch or pick, especially if you have the small rash breakout."

I leave the peel on for about 5 minutes (my skin can tolerate it)then wash my face and apply sunscreen.

I am a 40 yr old Asian American who has had great skin for years, then it suddenly changed. I started to get extremely dry under the eyes and started looking older than I should. I went to an aesthetician that prescribed me skinceutical products. They helped a little bit but a week ago my eyes puffed up and under my eyes were like prunes. They would not absorb any moisturizer. I drink a ton of water and have a humidifier on (live in Michigan). I looked like a scary monster. I planned on getting a peel done at a dermatologist in a couple of weeks but this could not wait. I came across this product that talked about exfoliating and drawing moisture into the cell. I came in a day and I applied it immediately for 1 minute as the direction said to start slow and build up. In one application my eyes became more taunt and hydrated! My husband noticed immediately. I could also tell when I went to put on moisturizer that my skin felt soft. I would HIGHLY recommend this product. There was no down time and it only tingled a little bit. I am so glad I found it. I will update in a couple of weeks."

I applied this at night, when I woke up my skin wasn't as oily as it normally is. I only powdered my face once today vs several times  while im at work. My face seems smoother, and brighter.

I just applied my first home peel ever and have to say it could not have been easier. The gel is easily applied and you can feel a tingle after 45 seconds, I left it on for a min. and a half the first time and probably should have done the minute only, I just wanted to see quick results. It has been an hour since I applied the peel and my skin already has a much healthier glow and looks more plump, I can't imagine how it will look after a few more applications. You can't beat the price, I have spent much, much, more on an array of products and none of them have made my skin look this glowing. This product is a must have!"

I use it under my eyes too once a week, my circles are finally fading!"
B000PNTQW0,2012,0,4.0,2,3,320,"Pleased with results","Overall I'm pleased with this product. I've been using it in the hopes of getting rid of breakouts in my cheeks and to fade hyperpigmentation from old zits. I have fair skin which is not oily at all. Every time I get a pimple it will leave behind a red mark whether I pick the pimple or not. If I don't pop my pimples they seem to take forever to resolve, although I am trying very hard not to touch them. The morning after my first use (1 minute) my skin looked great; marks looked lighter, pores looked tighter. However, in the following day my skin felt like it was flushing oil out and then I underwent a bad breakout. However, it resolved itself and it seems like when I do get a pimple it resolves more quickly and the marks fade more quickly as well. I followed the regimen of beginning slow and working up, but once I made it to five minutes I decided to try something new. I could feel a zit forming under my skin, so I dabbed on some of the product with a Q-Tip and left it on overnight. The next morning the zit had completely surfaced with a giant white head; gross! But I was able to squeeze it very gently and get all the junk out, and then I dabbed the spot again with a Q-tip dipped in product. By the end of the day I had a tiny red mark that looked like it had been healing at least a week. So now when I feel zits forming I do my Q-tip process and it helps a lot, plus I'll dab some on old marks to help fade them in-between full peels. I decided to purchase the saliyclic acid as well because I think the glyco/lac may not be enough to kill my zits, although perhaps it hasn't been long enough."

Both peels are wonderful and worked better than I expected.  I cannot be sure which peel is the cause, but the areas with eczema problems are less sensitive and my skin is so much calmer overall.  One suggestion to anyone who tries this with sensitive skin: I put the peel on my most sensitive patches of skin at the very end of the application process and never increase the time the peel stays on those areas."

The laser made my skin so dry and took the natural glow away. Then I found this glycolac peel which sounds so good to my acne and aging problem.

I did not go near my eyes with the product.  Hours later, both eyes were puffy, one was actually quite swollen underneath and bruised with reds and light purples.  The redness and puffiness has finally begun to subside (6 days later)  The worst part is that the swelling accentuates the creases and lines around my eyes and the skin around my left eye looks about 20 years older than I am (I am 47).

B000PNTQW0,2010,6,4.0,10,10,341,"Really Good Product!","I am 26 years old and have moderate acne (cystic, and pastules) and hyperpigmentation from the breakouts.  I have tried multiple topical products (including Retin-A, acne cleansers, serums, creams, and a Jessner's peel that was administered by a medical spa and cost $300, and IPL treatments) as well as natural supplements (zinc, herbs, brewers yeast, etc) and dietary changes (eliminating dairy, gluten, and sugar) all with little effect.		The Jessner's peel was the most effective treatment I had tried, but I hated the fact that my skin turns thick and looks like you have 2nd degree burns.  This lasts about 6 days and is embarrassing.  Besides, $300 a visit adds up quickly! So I found this peel.  It has glycolic and Lactic acids so it would address the active acne as well as the hyperpigmentation that old outbreaks left behind.  I have now used it 3 times with really good results.  It has significantly improved the tone and texture of my skin (my family has been commenting on how smooth my skin looks now) and has reduced the visibility of the old acne marks (they were not scars).  It has reduced the number of pimples I get significantly, but has not eliminated outbreaks altogether.  I would say it was JUST as effective as the much more expensive peel, but with many other benefits:  I can do it at home, my face does not peel/flake at all so I look normal, and I get multiple treatments out of a bottle.		As a note, I left the peel on for 3 minutes each time I have done the treatment (my skin is pretty tough after all the other procedures) and I had absolutely no visible signs of peeling.  It is very convenient!  I wish it would have stopped the outbreaks altogether, but overall I am very pleased.  I will certainly buy more of this company's products, but will try a stronger peel next time.  This peel has made me comfortable in my own skin again, and for that I am so grateful! Thank-you!!"

Directly after completing a peel (and I leave it on for no longer than 5 minutes, and apply it with a clean brush) my skin is very smooth and soft.  I then apply a disposable mask, a box of which I keep in the refrigerator, that cools my skin and quickly reduces any redness.

I've been using Glycolic peels for years in a stronger concentration so this was a step backwards for me. I got this product mainly for removing some sun damage. I have not used Lactic acid before and wanted to use a lighter concentration to start with. I have fair skin so any tiny bit of sun damage shows up fast. Always remember your sun screen!  :)		I've noticed some difference after 4 applications but not the improvement I was looking for. For myself in the future I will probably go back to using Glycolic separately from the Lactic unless I can find a product that has a stronger percentage of Lactic & Glycolic in it.		I do have one recommendation for those new to these type of products. Definitely try it out on the back of your hand to see how your skin will react and so you can get a good idea of what you have to do to neutralize the peel and completely rinse it off. Another poster gave a better description & instructions on mixing baking soda with water to neutralize. I also recommend you use baking soda. & don't be cheap when rinsing. You don't want to leave these types of products on your skin for longer than necessary.		Good Luck  :)"

B000PNTQW0,2010,2,5.0,8,8,475,"Gentle and not too scary to use","This was my first time buying (and using!) an at-home peel, and I have to admit that I was a bit scared when I used it for the first time two days ago.  I purchased this one since it said that it is good for evening out skin tone and getting rid of wrinkles, which are my main concerns.  The strength of this one is also supposed to be good for starting out.  I use Retin-A on a nightly basis so my skin is used to exfoliation, but I didn't want to aggravate anything since I'm prone to redness and sensitivity.  I'm hoping to build up to using a TCA peel in a few months, but everything I've read has said to build up to using a TCA peel by using gentler peels first.		The directions that come with this peel are excellent, and alleviated most of my nerves since they are so detailed and covered all of my questions.  They call for using gauze pads to apply the peel in a light, circular manner, and that seemed to work well.  Since this was my first time doing this, I only left it on for a minute and used a timer to time it.  It didn't sting too badly, but I could definitely feel it working.		Since this is considered a lighter, ""lunchtime"" peel, it didn't cause any actual peeling or flaking.  Instead, it got rid of some flakiness and dryness, and has left my skin really soft and hydrated-feeling, especially on my neck.  There was no irritation afterwards. It's too soon to notice any difference in my wrinkles, but supposedly that takes a few more peels.		I also made sure to use some emu oil on my face and neck three times a day for two days to heal the skin. Also, be warned that you aren't supposed to use any foundation on your skin for 24 hours after peeling so that it can heal.		I'm planning on doing this once a week for the next six weeks since supposedly that is the schedule that will yield the best results.  I will be sure to update my review as I go, but so far this is working great and has left a nice glow to my skin.		UPDATE ON 3/27/10:  I've used this peel three times now, and it is really making a huge difference in the clarity and brightness of my skin!  At the same time that I started using this, I also started using the Pretika cleansing brush, and the two together are making my skin brighter and my pores smaller.  I've also been using the peel on my neck and hands, and the skin there is also becoming softer, too.  I haven't noticed any peeling after using this, but am making sure to really moisturize well for a few days afterwards."

I was a bit concerned, but in fact this was the best week yet - very mild flaking and now my skin looks MUCH improved - smoother, and fading of a sun/age spot is noticed.  I'm 50, and have oily skin with large pores and some mild scarring.  I really see a difference!"
B000PNTQW0,2011,7,5.0,2,2,337,"Strong, really works","Careful~ I have been using this product for 4 months now. I still find that this is a strong product, not to be taken lightly! Do not use this product if you are using a retanoid creme, or under any other topical treatment for acne. Read the instructions very carefully and follow to the T, before you use this. And rinse it off completely. I used this once every 7-10 days for the first month, now I use it about once every 2-3 weeks. I get busy, and I'm not so good with weekly routines. When I first used it, I left it on only one minute-- with noticable difference~ Wow. My skin felt so smooth afterwards, no redness. Each time I use this, I can tell immediately after rinsing, the dead surface of my skin is gone. The second time (one week later) I left it on for 2 minutes....with some redness afterwards. So I went with 2 minutes about 10 days later, did better. The 4th time, I left it on 3 1/2 minutes~ had some redness for @ 4 hours, and the next day, some mild tiny sunburn like stripes on my upper cheeks. Lesson learned. So now....I just max out at 2 minutes. I feel safer. I don't want to hurt my skin. Please watch out with this product! It is strong. I know a few ladies have posted ""no redness or burning,"" but everyone is different. This is quite strong for me. I put Avalon organics Vitamin C face serum on afterwards. My skin looks bright and fresh after use, feels super clean, and a few lines I had have softened, although I don't have deep lines. It has helped lighten up some freckles/pigment on my lower cheeks that I did not like. I would never use this on my neck, its way too strong, keep it well away from the delicate eye area! It is not meant to be put on thin skin areas. This product is a professional strength product."

I think around the 3rd treatment I started to see a real difference in the texture and clarity of my skin. I've been to dermatologists and tried every product I could find to help my skin and I can't believe that I didn't know about this stuff!

But it's hilarious, now he's like, ""Let's go do a peel!"" He's on his 4th or 5th and he has been washing it off after 1 minute because he keeps thinking that he's going to get peeling and redness, but he's never had a bad reaction. Regardless of him only leaving it on for 1 minute each time, there have still been improvements to his skin texture and tone.	I will definitely order the peel again, I kind of want to try the HQ one but I worry that it sounds much stronger than this one, at least by the reviews."
B000PNTQW0,2010,10,5.0,2,2,72,"Baby soft skin!","I just got this and even after one time my skin looks amazing.  It made my skin so soft and cleared up all of my blemishes.  I was really nervous about using an at-home peel, but this one is very mild.  I left it on for about 4-5 minutes and it didn't hurt at all, just slightly itchy while it was on.  My face didn't peel or anything, just looks great :)"
B000PNTQW0,2010,0,3.0,4,5,58,"Great.... for the first few weeks","I really liked this product for the first few weeks. It didn't clear up my acne as much as I had hoped, but my face felt a lot clearer and smoother. After a few weeks though, it seemed as though my face was already used to it and I no longer had those good results I had before."
B000PNTQW0,2009,9,5.0,4,5,218,"incredible results - no more breakouts, smoother skin and reduced fine lines!","I just came on to Amazon to buy my 2nd shipment. I have also recommended this company/product to two other friends + my 62 yo mom who are converts.		I'm a fair-skinned, freckle faced 36 yo originally from Arizona. I spent my fair share in the sun and now am beginning to see the effects of this. On a regular basis, I would have chin breakouts and along my hairline. I also started developing sun spots (wider, browner freckles) on my forehead and cheekbone and fine lines around my eyes (I was anti-sunglasses in the past).  I'm going on 3 months of using this product weekly for 3-4 mins each time. I never peel, but my skin gets tight. I did work my way up... beginning at 30 secs the first time and so on... (I have ""sensitive"" skin so I was leery...)		My skin is smoother, some of my freckles have faded (especially the very prominent ones, my skin feels dewier and some of the crepe-like fine lines are less noticeable.  I also know it's working because I still get breakouts on my neck occasionally...so now I'm using the product on my neck to combat this.		My one downside:  It doesn't fade the freckles as much as I would like, but the other benefits outweigh this ""con""."
B000PNTQW0,2009,7,3.0,4,5,103,"Its ok....","I got this because I have some post acne hyperpigmentation along with some hyperpigmentation from the sun and I read that lactic acid is one of the best peels for hyperpigmentation. I have done 6 peels so far and I did them two weeks apart. I put like three layers of it on my skin and let it sit there for 10 minutes. I didn't have any peeling or anything which was good! It did fade some of my recent pigmentation but it really hasn't worked like I hoped! I think I might need something stronger. It didn't really help with breakouts either!"
B000PNTQW0,2008,8,3.0,8,11,200,"OK, though no peeling","I have this peel.  I had never used a peel before.  However, being a scientist I decided that I could study up on application and recovery and do it myself at home.  I purchased a cleanser, a prep solution, the peel and a healing balm for the procedure.  The first application had a little sting.  I was disappointed that I did not see much in the way of results.  I decided to wait a couple days and do the peel again.  I followed all of the steps.  I put the peel on a little thicker than the first time.  My skin stung more and it turned pink all over.  I thought;  ""YES!  This is going to finally peel!"".  No.  It did not happen.  This ""peel"" seems to make the skin more shiny and softer.  However, it does not make my skin peel.  I tend to have dry and sensitive skin, which is why I started with this peel.  I was hoping to get some of the skin discoloration from my pregnancy last year off my skin.  I will move on to a slightly different formulation with the next peel I order.  This one is more superficial than what I wanted."
B000PNTQW0,2012,10,3.0,1,1,76,"It's ok","I've been using it. I think it's doing good things for my skin. I don't really have problem skin so there wasn't anything to clear up. My skin gets dull so I was hoping this would help and it doesn't. Doesn't burn much at all. My face gets a little itchy. I don't leave it on for too long. I don't see any startling differences after I use it but that might just be my skin."
B000PNTQW0,2012,10,4.0,1,1,363,"Thought it was going to be more intense","This is kind of weird but this peel wasn't as intense as I expected it to be. I originally started out with Skin Laboratory's Salicylic Acid 20% peel and that burned my face the first time and then settled down and peeled a lot. Over the span of about 3 months, I did the Salicylic Acid peel about 6 times, each time increasing the amount of time for the product to stay on my skin. Now I upgraded to this Level 2 Glyco/Lac peel and it doesn't give me an intense burning sensation at all.  I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. Maybe my skin has become more resistant after the salicylic acid peel. I thought this glyco/lac peel was going to be more intense being that it is at a higher level than salicylic acid.		Hopefully this glyco/lac peel will show results. I just applied it for the first time. I will update this review in about 2 months after I am done with the whole process and then upgrade to a level 3 peel. It's amazing how I moving through the levels like this, I used to have extremely sensitive irritated skin. These peels have definitely helped slow the growth of my acne and faded much of my scarring. But don't think the scarring will go away over night b/c it won't. These peels should be done on a schedule, I do it every 10 days. You should always follow the exact instructions with these peels, don't stretch the rules at all. I did the first time with salicylic by reapplying a peel 3 days after the first application and I had horrible scarring from the peel for months. It finally went away after about 6 months of using every scar cream and natural solution in the book! It was a horrible time for me, I didn't even want to look in the mirror. So make sure you follow the directions, if you do then it will work fine for you but if you don't you can cause serious damage to your face, REMEMBER THESE ARE ACIDS YOU ARE PUTTING ON YOUR SKIN. BE CAREFUL."
B000PNTQW0,2008,9,5.0,6,6,51,"Great skin clearer","I have had such bad skin since starting new meds and this stuff is really working. I have been using it once a week for about a montha dn am seeing results. Great stuff and not too harsh for my sensitive skin, but wokrs far better than any other acne meds."
B000PNTQW0,2008,7,4.0,6,6,76,"Will do it again","I bought this, and tried to get my mom and sisters to do it with me, but they saw ""acid gel peel"" and wouldn't go near it. Well, they missed out because I used it about a week ago, and my skin is incredibly soft, and looks much better than when it did to begin with. I will let my skin have a break for a little while, and I'm definitely going to do it again!"
B000PNTQW0,2012,1,5.0,5,5,51,"Great 1st time Chemical peel","This peel has made such a difference in my skin.  My skin was dull, uneven, and blotchy.  Plus, I was breaking out terribly due to being pregnant. You would not believe the before and after pictures. After just four weeks, my skin is dewy, even, and fresh-looking.  AND no more breakouts."
B000PNTQW0,2010,8,5.0,5,5,76,"Easy to use, truly works","Graduated up to this product from the 35% which I used for three months prior.  I am trying to get a handle on skin cancer and find this product has done more for my skin than anything I have tried in years.  I like to think my Big angels put it in front of me.  I reccomend it to anyone that is wanting to help peel away sun damage and find healthy skin that lies under."
B000PNTQW0,2009,3,4.0,5,5,341,"Smells funky but works well","I love trying masks and peels. Some of my favorites are the L'Oreal salicylic acid peel and the DDF sulfur mask. This product was well priced and definitely worth a try. Something under 20 dollars makes it easier to experiment to see what works best for you and not feel terrible for wasting $ if its not what you expected.		 I have fair,freckled skin and have started to notice broken capillaries in my cheeks from sun damage. No one else notices, but, you know, when its your face, you see everything. I figured now in my late 20's, its time to start taking good care of my skin and treating it the best I can.		This peel is thin liquid gel and goes on nicely with a fan brush. I personally found the smell unpleasant, but nothing completely overpowering. I thought I had sensitive skin, but I can leave this peel on for 5 minutes or so with no discomfort. Just a little tingling. But, do make sure you read the directions and follow them well, because you don't know how your skin will react, some can only stand the peel for seconds at a time. When the time is up, I rinse off with cool water and then use a neutralizer cream that came with the L'Oreal kit as a finisher to re-moisturize a bit. It actually pairs nicely with the peel.		I've already used this one month on, one month off, and just started my 2nd month using the peel. I found that I kind of missed it and was happy to start using it again. It leaves my skin really soft with a more even tone. I don't peel necessarily, but if I rub my skin gently, the top layer seem to roll off and its grey and gross so I'm glad to be rid of it. No down time, you wouldn't even know I'd done the peel minutes before unless I mentioned it. I look forward to trying some of the other ones from this same company!"
B000PNTQW0,2009,5,5.0,7,8,112,"All the cosmetic help I need","I love this stuff. I'm 29 and just started having a noticeable crease on my face. When I stay up on this stuff, it is MUCH less noticeable. It also keeps my face smooth. I rotate it with the 20% salicylic peel. I will never have to buy an acne cream of any kind again. My pores are so clean that the blackheads I do get now show up and clear out fast.		Cleaner (peeled) skin also means that I only ever feel like putting Cetaphil on my face now. I don't feel like I need harsher cleaner to have a truly clean face. That's nice and certainly better for my skin."
B000PNTQW0,2009,3,5.0,7,8,29,"Great for Skin Care","This product works great.  Follow the directions exactly and you should not have any problems.  This is week 6 of my treatment and my acne spots are almost gone."
B000PNTQW0,2012,1,4.0,4,4,208,"Not as strong as I would have liked...","I have been using this product pretty consistently for the past 3 months. This was my first at home peel, so I did a lot of research on what solutions and % would work best with my skin issues. I am mid 30s, medium skin tone, dry and sensitive skin, with a lot of areas of sun damage and hyper pigmentation.	I went with the latic acid combo because reviews and recommendations said it was best for dry skin and dark spots.	I have used it about every 5-7 days.	My skin feels absolutely amazing after I finish the peel. Very smooth and radiant. Started with leaving it one for only a minute, then have increased to 4 minutes. A little itching, not much stinging, even directly after a microderm abrasion. No frosting at all, very little redness on face, no peeling. (My neck and chest however, which is super sensitive, turned very red, but disappeared quickly.)	Dark spots are only a little lighter.	I think this is a great peel to start with, to prep skin for something a little more intense.	Overall, great product, makes skin very smooth... I do love using this on my hands! Will be ordering a level 3 or 4 next round."
B000PNTQW0,2011,7,4.0,4,4,125,"Pretty Good Product","I am happy with the Glyco-Lac/60,Level 2 Gel Peel. Being a woman of color in my early 40's with very sensitive, blemished skin, I have always had to be very careful with what I choose to put on my face. This product is working very well but you have to follow the directions carefully. I have noticed my skin is clearer  &  the wrinkles are less noticeable. I have used the same bottle 3 times already and I can see the change which is nice. And the price is Much less than if I went to a doctor for this same peel. I saved around $300.00	My advice to anyone thinking of using this is be patient. It works. I am a very satisfied consumer."
B000PNTQW0,2011,1,5.0,4,4,304,"Transformed my skin!!!!!","For years I have been battling a difficult complexion. It seemed as though every pore on my face was clogged. I had blackheads all over my chin, nose, and forehead but they were not easily seen on the surface; they were deep. I've tried creams, scrubs, masks and gizmos but nothing provided effective treatment. Per the recommendation of my best friend (who is an aesthetician but lives far away from me) I decided to give this a try. She mentioned that the combination of glycolic acid and lactic acid was particularly effective since the glycolic works on the surface and the lactic acid goes deeper. I did not see results right away, but the enclosed leaflet recommended weekly peels for 6 weeks, so that's what I did. Other reviewers noted that they did not experience peeling and neither did I; it was more of a flakiness after a day or two. Therefore, I used a gentle enzyme scrub (try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MASTNI"">MyChelle Fruit Enzyme Scrub, 2.3-Ounce Tube</a>) about 3 days after the peel to help with the flakiness. It's been 6 weeks since my first peel and all I can say is WOW!!!! The first couple of weeks were a bit rough: my skin seemed to break out a bit but I believe it was just all of the gunk coming to the surface. About 3 to 4 weeks in my skin started really looking good!	NOTE: I also had some melasma on my upper lip and a few age/sun/melasma spots on my cheeks and I have seen a significant reduction (the melasma on my upper lip is gone!!! YAY!!!).	This is serious stuff! It is not comfortable for the few minutes you have it on, but you will get serious results if you stick with it and are diligent with your skin care regimen."
B000PNTQW0,2012,8,5.0,1,1,108,"Highly Recommend","This product greatly improved my sun spots and fine wrinkles on my face.  On first use I left it on for 1 minute, but found the next morning that I didn't see much affect.  Two nights later I reapplied and left on for five.  It definately tingles, but is bareable.  I rinsed off with a water and baking soda mix to neutralize it and followed up with clinique spot corrector.  The next morning there was definate fading.  I hope it continues.  I did find it also brought out a few pimples that were under the surface but they dried up and were gone in a day.  Great product."
B000PNTQW0,2012,4,5.0,1,1,179,Great!,"Just received this in the mail 2 days ago and have completed my first ""peel"". I have tried sal/glyc peels in the past, but decided to go with the glyc/lac peel this time. The sting/tingling is completely bearable compared to others that I've tried. I only left it on for a minute just to be safe, and I tend to have sensitive skin. Better safe than sorry, right?		I have combination skin, and medium-dark spots from sun damage and pimple scars. I have a few problem pimples here and there, Caucasian, mid twenties, female.		This peel is light enough to not freak out when you put it on your face, mild, mild, mild tingling. The next day I had no redness (only left it on for a minute!) but I felt my skin was smooth and more 'comfy' feeling. No peeling yet, and the directions say that you may not peel at all, but to exfoliate a week or so after the application.		So far so good! I will update when I do my next peel in a week."
B000PNTQW0,2012,2,4.0,1,1,183,"Works great for acne...not sure on wrinkles and dark marks.","I have to say I have noticed a huge improvement with my 'adult acne'. I hate those words, lol.  I primarily bought if for fine lines but I am amazed at how it has reduced not only the number of breakouts by like 90 percent. But also the duration...they are gone within a day! It also works pretty well at lightening the dark circles under my eyes and I see some increased toning in my face and neck after applying...this doesn't last that long though. We'll see how the fine lines and dark marks go with further use.  But just the fact that this has reduced my breakout so dramatically will help the dark marks caused by acne tremendously.  I have used it 3 times so far, 5 days a part. 1st time for 1 minute, the next time for 2 or 3mins and the last time for 4 min.  My skin is sensitive so I was def feeling it after 4 minutes!! I rinse with water, then with baking soda & with water(mixed well so it is not gritty)and with water again."
B000PNTQW0,2012,1,5.0,1,1,108,"LOVE LOVE LOVE","Cost effective, and just as good as any salon can deliver.	It doesnt hurt for me but i did start with a LVL1 product first.	I highly recommend this- it leaves my face very smooth and was worth every penny. I use it less than once a month.		It makes a HUGE difference in the quality of my skin. I did over use at first as i was over zelous. Now that i use it less often it helps to keep my skin fresh and smooth, if i use weekly i get red and blotchy and gross. Find what works for you and do not overexfoliate. Highly rec!"
B000PNTQW0,2011,11,2.0,1,1,123,"I dont see any improvement?","I wanted to give this a month or so before I commented on what I thought, I got it around the 1st week of Nov and I have been using it once a week, I dont really see a difference at all in my face? I did have a zit on my lower cheek and I spot treated there, I dont know hopefully it looks okay but it didnt today...also around that area it looks like I fell and scabbed my face, I noticed that happened in another area last time, and the 1st time this patch by my eye got dry and started peeling then I got another patch by my nose, I dont know I dont really see an improvement yet?"
B000PNTQW0,2011,8,5.0,1,1,271,"Great, not too harsh","I am 27 and I do not sunburn easily...not at all really - so I certainly don't have sensitive skin. Still, I had never done any sort of peel before so I was cautious - I left the peel on for 2 minutes the first time, 3.5 the second and 5 full minutes the third time - all spaced 1 week apart. I felt tingling, nothing major. The third time I did get some red peeling on my nose (I had a cold, so it may have been more sensitive bc of repeated tissue action), but otherwise minimal flaking.	I just used my olay brush in the shower and cetaphil moisturizer with spf 50.	Quite a few people have said that my skin looks great :) so it def worked - skin looks smooth and clear.		This is gross, but the peel removed the top layer of dead skin, so my black heads all came out super easily.		The lactic acid is supposed to be good for undereye circles, so I tried applying it there (VERY carefully). I made sure to do this portion of my face last since I was a bit nervous to use something on such a delicate area. Surprisingly, it didn't burn or peel horrible at all. I can't really tell yet if it is working there though, since my undereye circles are so dark...		One more thing, I used alcohol to remove my skin's natural oils, applied the peel, waited the prescriped time, and jumped in the shower, rinsing my face for a few minutes. I tried the baking soda thing and really didn't like it."
B000PNTQW0,2011,5,5.0,1,1,81,"Must have product!","This is my first time using the Glyco-Lactic combo peel. I used the Lactic Acid Peel before and really liked so I thought I would give this one a try. I have fair sensitive skin and this is amazing! It really decongests the skin and makes it nice and smooth and clear. Be careful and read the directions so you do not get burned! Especially around the nose area can be very sensitive to these peels. I highly recommend this product!"
B000PNTQW0,2011,5,5.0,1,1,297,Working!,"I had started my peel process with the Glycolic level 1. Since this is 'first time use', I was cautious on doing this very lightly..after all, it is your face. After a use of about (6) treatments I did notice a small amount of change. Note that the bottle is for a (6) treatment application. I went very light on each use, and still have 1/2 the bottle left. Never really felt but a slight 'tingle' and only left on for about 3-5 minutes. Did not notice much redness or peeling, just a bit of 'flaking'.  Followed directions to the letter.		Since this was slow process, (on a well-used sun-baby geezer), I decided to try the Glyco-Lac/60. Recommended for heavier blemishes and sun damage.  Did the same as above, slow start until comfortable. Started seeing a bigger-faster result. Moved up to a full 8-10 minute application period. I now am noticing much faster results. More redness and heavier peeling. On applying it is more of a tingling-warm effect,(nothing painful).  I have not had any 'blistering or heavy scabbing'. It does take longer for the redness to diminish. But it positively is working. Since my face  has seen a lot of years in the sun, many of the spots are deep, so it is a matter of time before they are much lighter or gone, and that is fine, as long as I achieve end result.		I will use up the 'Lac 60' and save the 'level 1' for follow-up and touch-up.		As other 'reviewers' have said: Pay attention to the application process and do not expect overnight results. My skin tone is more on the olive-side. As a kid always got a heavy tan without redness or burning, rarely ever peeled. So take your complexion in consideration."
B000PNTQW0,2011,3,3.0,1,1,58,"So far, so good","I've used the product 4 times so far. I can't really tell if it's helping in any way. It does tingle when I put it on, and feels like it's working. I'll use it one more time and then stop for a while, as some other reviewer had mentioned that it shouldn't be used in the summer months."
B000PNTQW0,2010,11,5.0,1,1,94,"Good stuff, but careful","I have some skin pigmentation, olive complexion and no skin sensitivities/conditions other than mixed oily/dry. This is a fantastic product I now use regularly for peeling, every week or so. It has restored my skin back to its luminous state. At first I used too much product on the sides of my nose, which caused some excessive peeling, but now I've found a balance. The exfoliation is a great way to get rid of milia, btw.

I put pure aloe vera on it in hopes for it to soothe the burning, but that was a challenge in itself as well. My face felt so tight, it hurt to open my mouth wide enough to eat anything.

I tried this cream after reading the reviews even though it seemed pretty expensive to me.  I used it for about a month (still have some left so it lasts a long time, thats a plus!) and I didn't have a negative experience like some of the other reviewers had shared.  However, I didn't really notice any huge difference either so for me, its kind of a middle of the road product; not great but not terrible.  For the price, I'm afraid it was not worth it in my book.

Besides it being half the price and making my skin look and feel like I hoped this other cream would (my fine lines are noticeably less noticeable!), they give you this tea tree blemish stick for free which is the coolest thing in the world if you ever get pimples or blemishes of any kind.

Upon receipt of this cream, I saw the ingredients included triethanolamine (TEA) and methyl- and propyl-parabens, easily investigated on the web by Googling the names.  These ingredients have been identified in research as potential carcinogens.  The TEA mimics estrogen, and thus, may also be a teratogen and mess up developing (embryonic) systems.  Furthermore, mineral oil is one of the major ingredients of this rather expensive cream.  So, back it goes!  Mothers and grandmothers may have thought well of this cream, but they did not have the science then as we do now.  I feel that the manufacturer's lack of disclosing the ingredients on the website is an attempt to deceive unaware buyers."

In fact I thought this cream was very heavy on my face and did not absorb into my skin very well. So it goes into the wasteland of creams on my nightstand and under my counter and chalk it up as a wasted $35 on my part.	After reading all the five star reviews (many of which is their only review on Amazon) you would believe that this is the next miracle cream.  My original review stands, it does nothing for my skin besides moisturize, I have seen no difference in wrinkles.  If you are just looking for a moisturizer then be my guest and buy this product.

I ordered the product on 10/30/12, received it around 11/6/12 and started using it after I finished my current products about 2 weeks later.  About a week after using the product I noticed that my skin was starting to get very irritated.  I realized that it may be related to the change of facial products.  I stopped using eb5 and returned to my regular skin care regimen.  It took about 10 days for my skin to resolve.  By the time all of this happened, I was about a week past the 30 day return policy.		I called the 800 customer service number for the company and spoke to the customer service person about my reaction to the product.  He did the calculations and kept saying, ""Come on now, come on now."" I told him if that is the way he's going to treat me that I would write a public review of my experience with the product and with him.  Then he said, ""I'm going to give you your money back, but COME ON NOW.""  I told him that if that's the way you're going to treat me that I didn't want the refund.		I immediately hung up and am writing this review.		Lessons learned:		1)  If you have sensitive skin, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!		2)  If you want to be treated like a valued customer, DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY!		Hope this helps those of you who are doing research online to figure out if this is a good company to deal with!"

In the past I have also tried products by clinique, neutrogena, mary kay, say yes to carrots among others.  I decided to give eb5 a try.  The thing that influenced me to purchase the product was reading the reviews by customers who had been loyal to this brand for years.  The face cream does perform well, it is not greasy.  I tend to use it at night since it does not contain a sunscreen.  In comparing it to other products, the thing that stands out other than it's performance is that you need so little.  The directions state to use the amount the size of a pearl...and that is accurate.  So, this product will last a really long time.  The olay product I was using, ""olay regenerest night recovery cream"" comes in a 1.7 ounce jar and I had finished it in 4-5 weeks.  This product will last much longer, so that is a money saver.

One the second day, more wrinkles were noticeable and my husband asked me if I was over-tired.  I kept with my new ""formulas"" for about a month, but finally came back to EB5 and am so glad I did.  On the first day back of using this product, my face is fresh, young and smooth.		I am now convinced that the ingredients in this product are in trace amounts, and unless I come up with some organic and natural concoction on my own - I will always be fighting ""questionable"" ingredients in my beauty products.

This cream sits on top of my face, not really moisturizing it deep down.		I tried the cream this long before posting it's because I want to give it a fair review.		Other moisturizers such as Shiseido really absorb into my skin and leaves my face watery dew moist, not tight and stiff like the eb5 facial cream.		Shiseido moisturizers works really well, but it is expensive. So, I'm going to try other brands from Walgreens or CVS. I will alternate the use between them. Experts say generally, they all have the same ingredients, more of less...		Also, I've read a review, after buying eb5, saying that the company ask their employees to give a high review on this product as an incentive. Not too good."

There are no oily or dry areas, just normal beautiful skin.  The cream soaks into the skin, so it makes for a great primer for foundation.

I loved the light, silky feel and how it quickly absorbed. I loved the bottle it came in. It was small, nice and dispensed a good amount of lotion. It even had sunscreen in it! I decided to try something new and different (maybe better!) So I went with eb5. I think I regret this purchase. The cream is heavy, it doesn't absorb easily. It feels greasy and the jar method of using it can get messy. It doesn't have sunscreen. Well I can't return it because I used the piping method (like you do for decorating a cake) to try and shove this eb5 cream into the ROC bottle. Results were hilarious and overall successful, but it was a greasy mess. Next time I will probably get ROC again. I'm not a huge fan of this cream. It seems like when I wear it, my fiance sneezes a lot. We were in bed together and he got close to my face and started sneezing, complaining that it felt like a phantom traveled up his nose and behind his eyes (LoL).

There are only two drawbacks to this product: 1) It will dry out your skin, so wear a lotion and 2) The active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, is a bleaching agent, so it will bleach fabric.

However, the only downside is that it can be fairly irritating to my face, specially if I use a little too much. My skin will be somewhat red and have a slight burning sensation after I wash my face.

Then I picked up Clean & Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser at the grocery store, and after a few weeks of daily use I haven't had another breakout and most of my preexisting acne has healed as well (woot!).		Obviously I am very happy with the results that this cleanser has produced, but to be perfectly honest I don't really care for the product itself. It's VERY thick, more of a paste than a liquid really, which makes it difficult to lather and rinse off. It also stings my eyes no matter how carefully I avoid getting it near them, and the menthol sometimes makes my face uncomfortably ""tingly"" and raw afterward. Moisturizing is also a definite must when using this wash because it WILL dry you out no matter how accustomed your skin already is to 10% BP products (but honestly, moisturizing is a good idea regardless of what cleanser you use).		In the big picture these issues are really a small price to pay for clear skin and I have every intention of continuing to use this product, but they are irksome enough that I had to give this cleanser 4 stars instead of 5. My recommendation is that if you can find a more pleasant face wash that works for you, get that.

It's not over drying like some other products. While I thought that very dry might be good as oil seems to be the problem, drying tends to cause more problems than benefits. This cleans well without drying.<p>It's very thick. It has the consistency of vegetable shortining or cream cheese. Where most creams are thin like soaps tend to be, this could be compared to a cold cream or noxema's traditional cream.<p>There's a strong tingling that comes with using this. The product suggests it is the 'deep cleaning' - I'd argue it's menthol or something similar to suggest deep cleaning. When they say on the label ""don't use near eyes"" take heed. Whatever makes it tingle will spread to your eyes if you wash too close and it's not pleasant. Its never burned or be unbearable but for about 20 minutes after use too close to the eyes you'll be aware you just washed your face.<p>I'm not sure I buy the suggestion that ""it deposits benzoyl peroxide in your pores"" but it has kept all but one significant blemish off my face for about 6 weeks now. Even that one blemish I could blame on my lack of attention to regular cleansing.<p>It's certainly good stuff. I definately recommend it but don't buy all the advertising pitches.

It doesn't take away all the oil like some other facewash does, but I think that's part of why it works.  It NEVER dries your skin out by removing too much oil.  It also has the strongest concentration of Benzoyl Peroxide I've seen in an onver the counter product (10%).  This does wonders for me and if this product ever went away I'd be screwed.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it can be expensive in stores, and you can run out of it quick if you don't ration it correctly.  Even though it's a cream that doesn't spread that well, you don't need very much for it to be effective.

It is still going away. Maybe that was just because final exams were rolling around in school but, either way I have a couple issues with this product.		First and foremost, the ingredients contain petrolatum, a petroluem based jelly. I can't help but feel that putting in petroleum jelly which can further aggravate acne in a good chunk of people with more sensitive skin to be a bit counter-productive. I am sure that for those without sensitive skin issues that the petrolatum would be no issue. I am guessing this contributed to my problem because the amount of the solid ""gunk"" that could be seen in my pores increased. I know some of you know what I am talking about.		Second, I feel it takes a pretty good sized glob to get a good lather going. Otherwise it feels like I am rubbing mostly water on my face. With a small blob the cleanser just gets watery and runs down my arms, which is annoying I must admit. It's tough to find the ""right amount"" for this product.

""Applying and leaving on""  ""Applying 3 times a week"" ""Using as a daily exfoliator""	If your not going to seek the advice of your dermatologist or esthetician, please buy a book on Chemical Peels to understand how they work.	Applying more that once every 10 days will thin out your skin and will cause problems down the line. The whole point of ""Peeling"" is to clear away the old dead skin cells and allow new ones to surface. It takes your skin (depending on age) 20-42 days for brand-new skin cells to work their way up to the surface of the epidermis, if your constantly stripping your damaging your new skin cells. Patience is needed with peels and generally a series of 4-6 are needed depending on your expectations. Always apply spf of 30 or more afterward and before starting with this 50% lactic prime your skin a week before by using 2-5% glycolic wash. And PLEASE seek the advice of your friendly neighborhood dermatologist and/or esthetician before even attempting to peel.

It not only made the skin look softer any other products I put on for a couple of days after using this seem to be absorbed better so it makes my moisturisers etc seem to work better too.  My skin does go a little pink for a few hours after use so I would recommend it as best to use before bed time and to make sure you follow the directions carefully as I could see how it could burn your skin if left on too long.  Also make sure you wear lots of sunscreen on your face for the weeks you are using this as I've heard horror stories of home peels sensitizing faces to sun damage and people ending up with brown blotchy faces.

It really improved the dull red appearance and my make-up goes on so much better.I'm getting compliments on my skin again! Oh one more thing,as someone pointed out,you HAVE to be really good about using sunscreen whenever you use a peel,otherwise you'll damage your new skin."
B000PNXBU8,2009,4,5.0,26,29,123,"Exceeded my expectations","I used this peel on my leg and had the first peel May 27. Although the company said this would be good for hyperpigmentation, I didn't know just how good ... until now. I've had some brown spots from a laser procedure and I've used so many depigmenting creams/gels but they didn't work. Apparently this one is since they are slowly fading now. I'll do my second peel soon and I'm hoping for more improvement.		ETA: I did my second peel today and there's more improvement: The spots are fading more. I can't wait for my sixth peel, which will happen sometime later this month. Since I'm used to AHAs, my skin can tolerate peels every five days. And this peel is nonirritating."

I have to say I was pretty sceptical as I'm an aesthetician and had a hard time belieiving it would work as well as the peels I had done on clients in the office. For safety issues we would have never sold professional peel products to anyone to do at home. This product works just as well. Just be careful, it is very strong.

Use as directed!		Comparing this to the other acid treatments, this one is the best.

I am Black/Filipino (medium brown complexion) and it helped with my acne and my hyper-pigmentation in just the first use. People assume now that I'm wearing make-up when I have none on!! Make sure to follow the directions, and I waited longer between each peel than suggested, but still had excellent results.

She said the Lactic Acid 50% gel was a little light chemical peeling for her aged skin. So, I ordered a higher percentage gel for her which is Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel.

B000PNXBU8,2013,1,5.0,0,0,230,"I like this product a lot - it is a big money saver.","First, this is a strong acid peel and you have to take it seriously when you apply it by following the instructions explicitly. I have a chemistry back ground, so I felt comfortable using it on myself. If you do not have anything in your back ground that gives you understanding about these peels then I would strongly suggest doing some reading first, so that you can familiarize yourself with them and get an understanding of how this stuff works. Watching a you-tube video put out by someone who is qualified is a good alternative if you are not much of a reader.		That said this is a great product! I use it sporadically. Maybe once a week for a month or every other week for two months depending on the condition of my skin. Then I take a break - you only have so much dead skin cells to take off after that you are damaging yourself. I get great results in terms of line reduction, miniaturization and improving the evenness of my skin tone.		It burns because its an acid at a relatively high concentration, so you can try a lower concentration or just prepare yourself for the fact that it hurts.  Redness last for a day or two and do not use other treatments for several days before or after - I suspect it would be painful."

B000PNXBU8,2013,1,5.0,0,0,460,"Another great peel","I am pretty sure I have previously written about their glycolic peel, as I had used it for several years, usually in the winter months, from when I was 20ish to 23-24.		I love that peel as it really helped clear up my skin on a permanent basis from the time I first started using it. It also helped with skin pigmentation from breakouts/scars which is why I primarily started using, I had very uneven skin tone and lots of scar dots.		You just need to be patient, do it weekly, then go on a break. Make sure you moisturize and stay out of the sun because YOU WILL BURN! DONT TAN EITHER.		I just tried their lactic peel to switch it up. I let it sit for 8 minutes, (wouldn't recommend for beginners, it took a while to build up to that with the glycolic peel, it does sting alot when you first start using them, but everyone is different)		I then used a bar of sulphur soap as the soap to wash it off. Put alot of the soap into my hands, and then massaged the soap and peel already on my face for probably about 5 minutes. The combination of the sulphur soap and any of the peels really works into your pores to clear everything out. I never get as good as results without the peel. Then I used warm/hot water to flush everything out.		Skin looks really fresh and very cleaned out. I have a few months before moving to Hawaii from cloudy Seattle so I want to even out my skin as much as possible before I am in the sun to much to use the peels.		This company is highly recommended. I used to get microdermabrasion, but almost everytime each person was an idiot and a couple times literally took off to much skin, ended up with lines and scars. The glycolic peel back then helped even everything out that the dermabrasion screwed up.		Key words are just to be patient, realise its going to take a couple months to do work on scars, but in the short term either peel really should help clear out the skin, and keep acne away.		If you can, the best luck I have had with other skin products are using sulphur soap (available on amazon), biore blackhead face wash (green with beads in it, can't really find it in stores anymore but this has always been my favorite face wash), Walgreen Alphahydroxy face cream (in the past this also helps tremendously with breakouts), and any noncomengenic, hyper-allergenic lotion to keep your face moisturized. Also noncomengenic and hyper-allergenic are the key words you want to see in your sunscreen to make sure it doesn't break you out."

I'm so excited and hope to see more improvement with more treatments.. I'm particularly hopeful that it helps some with the scarring.  I thought this was very mild (although I only left it on 1-2 minutes) and next time may go up to the next strength.  I'm not an experienced user, but I do use a lactic acid lotion daily, so maybe that's why my skin isn't as sensitive to it as some.  I'm going to stay hopeful that I'll see improvement with more treatments!!!"
B000PNXBU8,2012,3,5.0,4,4,256,"Good Starter Peel","I've only done two peels using this so far (also used a 50% Glycolic peel after the lactic peel), but my skin already looks a 100 times better! I had a few spots/scars that just would not go away...after just a little over a week, they are fading and healing, and my skin feel so fresh. I would say that the lactic peel is much more mild than the glycolic, but I do like using them together. Also, I would definitely not use more than once a week to ten days, since peels can thin your skin and cause long term damage if abused. Also, DO NOT exfoliate before or after using this. The peel does that for you.		I used the lactic acid first and then followed with the 50% glycolic. Which is probably not great for sensitive skin or a novice...I've been using 30% glycolic pads 2-3 times per week for the past two years, so my skin was accustomed to the stinging. Start out slow and follow with a good moisturizer. I've recently discovered coconut oil and have been using that after peels. I have combo to oily skin, I'm 30 years old and still get the occasional breakout. The coconut goes on oily, but absorbs quickly and does not clog my pores at all. I feel like it really takes the sting out of the peel too and calms my skin down. There is a lot of research that it helps with acne too. Just a suggestion...every person's skin is different though."

I used to have severe acne, so my face is covered in scars. Now I just have moderate acne, and this peel helps target that as well.		Even though this product seems more gentle than the other peels, you still should not use it more than once a week. Also, always remember your SPF!"

B000PNXBU8,2012,11,5.0,2,2,803,"If you are new to peels, this is a great one to start with.","This peel is a great way to start if you are new to peels because its hard to go wrong with it and it will allow you to practice your technique before you get into peels that have a higher potential for damage. My initial experience with peels were at a salon and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZPOJ0"">MD Formulations My Personal Peel System</a> ( 20% glycolic). I read that Lactic acid was milder than glycolic so decided to go with the 50% Lactic to start with. I don't know the specifics of how this works but your face has to build up a tolerance level to the peels so thats why they recommend you start low and build up. We all want immediate results and some people have resistant skin that can get away with plunging in to the deeper peels right away but, personally, I don't want to find out that I am not one of them after the fact. Its my face, I can't hide it, so I'd rather be safe than sorry.		The first time I tried this peel, I started with a one minute application. I noticed mild tingling and not much else but the next morning my face felt sooo soft and moisturized, I loved it. I added 1 min each time until I was doing 5-6 minutes.  I noticed a subtle improvement on my face each time and was so impressed. I've struggled with stubborn, resistant hyper-pigmentation (melasma) around my eyes for years. I tried countless products that seemed to work for others but did not work for me. Only photofacials had been able to remove it but it returned with the slightest bit of sun (hyper-active melanocytes) so photofacials were just too expensive as a temporary solution.  These peels, week by week, (along with a combination of other products I have listed on my profile), slowly faded them. As I moved on to stronger peels, its like 95% gone.		NOTES ON PEELS:	-Don't do it more often than they recommend.  They recommend you do it every so often for a reason. Your skin has to have time to heal and develop new skin before you strip it away again.	-You HAVE to wear sunblock. Your skin is more exposed and vulnerable to damage from sun. Protect it. If you don't you are canceling out or even reversing your progress. I like this one, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZF75LS"">Ole Henriksen Protect the Truth Sunscreen SPF 50+-1.7 oz</a>.  Its not the best moisturizer but as a sunblock, its great.  Its my favorite because its hard to find high spf that doesn't leave a white haze, smell funky or make your eyes tear up.	-When you are doing your peels, make sure you start with a clean DRY face, water will dilute the acid in your peel. I am wondering if thats why some people did not see any results.  I wash my face, swipe it with alcohol on a cotton ball to remove any leftover oils and to help dry it. Wait 10-15 minutes, then apply the peel.	-Use a fan brush like this one<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NMF63W"">Taklon Fan Mask Brush Acid Applicator for Glycolic Lactic TCA Skin Peel / Masques (Small)</a>. Mine has lasted over a year. You can use cotton balls/squares but I think they absorb product so you will waste some and get less peels out of your bottle.	-Watch your face when the peel is on.  The recommended time is a guideline, everyones skin is different and reacts differently. Thats why they recommend you start slow.  Some are ok 1 min the first time, others the full 4 min.  Once your skin starts looking pinkish, its time to remove. If it gets red, you've gone too long.	-Make sure you wash off ALL of the acid. Wash, rewash, wash again.  I like to shower right after to make sure its all gone.  Any leftover acid will continue to work its way into your skin. I like to use a post peel neutralizer as an extra precaution. MD Formulations had a post peel neutralizer that was AWESOME but they don't sell it individually. I am trying this one <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VEN3RW"">Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.</a>. It works but I am still trying to find one more like the MD formulations one.  You pour onto cotton ball and sweep your face right after peel, then wash it off with water. You can also mix your own neutralizer using baking soda and water.	-Moisturize after. This one has been my favorite to use after, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00700H128"">Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl(r) 3000, Argireline(r), Hyaluronic Acid & Natural Botanical Extracts</a>. I also use it as a night cream. Very moisturizing and doesn't feel greasy or leave a residue."

I won't lie, I flit from thing to thing to thing... only keeping a few staples in my life - the stuff that is so great I don't think I'll ever change! This product just might join the elite few! For the record, I had a few chemical peels from my dermatologist (at $100 a pop, and you need at least 3) and my whole face would peel off and look totally gross for a couple of days.  Yes, the skin underneath looked amazing, but really, who wants to look like Medusa for a couple of days in order to look like Venus?? I really didn't, especially now that my boyfriend lives with me.  (he would love me anyhow, but he would think I was NUTS if he saw all the crap I do to be pretty lol) So after reading reviews, I decided to try this stuff. But, I got scared and didn't use it at first (what if I burned off my face?? lol) So finally the other night I went for it... And I love it!  I've only used it twice now- and I have a hand held red light therapy light that I use right after it so that may help - but it's pretty dang awesome. In fact, I had to force myself not to use it too soon - as I know that is counter-productive lol. You get that immediate fresh look from the peel but without the gross peeling. I have some acne spots on my chin area (from stress) that I am trying to get rid of, and some fine lines.  It's already faded out some (not all) of the acne and the fine lines aren't nearly as noticeable. (which is why I have to force myself not to use it too soon! Immediate Results are impressive!) The tingling/burning isn't nearly as bad as at the doctors, and I kinda like it (yes, that's weird, I know)  I know that final results will show after a couple of months of using... so I will post again in a month to let you guys know what I think."

I have had professional peels and I get a facial once a month.  I started to use this peel once a week because I was nervous about over exfoliating my face.  It really is not difficult to use and it was gentle for my skin; this may be because I have had peels done before.  Since I started using this product my face is glowing and I have fewer breakouts.  I don't feel a need to get monthly facials, although I may continue because I emjoy them.  I would recommend this product to anyone who does not want to pay for facials and wants to improve their skin without using harsh acne medications.

It also caused my already scar prone skin to scar even worse then before. With that said, I recently (like 5-6 months ago) had an onslaught of breakouts especially in the forehead area. I finally bought the Lactic acid so I could prepare my skin for using a TCA peel. After reading reviews on TCA on African-American kin, especially darker ones like me, I thought i was pretty much screwed, but tried it anyway. After my first use, I felt no tingling, no sensation, nothing and thought it hadn't worked and I needed 70%. Then I tried it again later that week. My face was on complete fire!! I even ended up with a few burns where my scars already were. Every time I use it, my skin gets a little bit more sensitive to it.		As far as results- I love them. I have naturally dry peeling, flaking skin, so I saw a little bit of peeling with this, and I love the way my face looks a few days later. Its brighter, the scars a re a little lighter and my skin tone more even with each day after. My mom loves the way it makes her skin so soft.		All in all, after waiting for almost a year to purchase this, I am beyond happy that I did. My face hasnt looked this great in a good year or so."

The first time I applied it with a cotton ball...very lightly and washed it off after only 3 minutes due to reviews about burning.  The next two apps I used a gauze pad folded in fours (like the directions suggest) and applied a thicker coat.  I left it on for at least 10 minutes both times.  Yes, it stung like a sunburn so I just sat in front of a fan...no big deal.  It was not very painful at all.  Once it's washed off there is no burning what-so-ever.

I have also tried many other acne medications over the years (I'm 26 now) and while it wasn't the worse I've tried, it certainly isn't the best.  One thing I will give it credit for is lack of side effects.  I did not experience any dryness, pealing, nothing crazy like that.		But like I said, it only took care of the problem slightly.  I have learned that for some things, products made specifically for females tend to work better.  Don't ask me why but women's deodorant works ten times better than the best males deodorant I ever used.  I will use my girlfriend's deodorant and not sweat at all versus when I use my own, it just doesn't work as good.  The same goes for acne medication.  I have been using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFSTBA"">Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Cream Cleanser, 6.7-Ounce</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009YCEMU4"">100% Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Blemish Roll-on Stick with Tea Tree Oil</a> for the past couple months.

I would not have thought putting a minty smelling oil on my face would make such a difference, but I'm telling you it freakin works.  I have never had this clear of skin in my life, period.  I recommend looking into a fragance and oil free face wash and a tea tree oil of some sorts.  Literally night and day when i look at my face now."

I'm in my 30's with mild acne (with occasional flare ups) and have been on Proactiv for years.  After a few years, I noticed Proactiv was really irritating my skin and my face ended up really red and I was starting to break out again.		Frustrated with my situation, I decided to give Nature's Cure a try.  Working from the ""inside out"" through immune system seemed like a reasonable concept.  First two weeks I did not notice much of a difference.  So I decided to also supplement with 50 mg of Zinc Gluconate daily which helps boost your immune system (and has been shown in studies to help with acne).		WOW.  I'm on week 7 now and my skin is in GREAT shape.  I rarely get pimples now and the ones I do are small and go away fast.  The Nature's Cure and Zinc Gluconate combo has been an outstanding 1-2 punch for me against acne.

I think I'm the minority in which months of proactiv did not help stop future breakouts.		The problem with all of these treatments is that they're all topical and don't correct the imbalances within the body due stress, etc.  When I first saw this product, I thought I had nothing to lose and it was cheap.  I've been using this product for months.  Using a popular off-the-shelf skin moisturizer, it's stopped major breakouts and limited ones that were going to appear.  The results I had with this product compared to the ones above were the difference between night and day.  I believe the tablets helped cure the body's internal imbalances, which were ultimately leading to breakouts that topical creams could not stop.  I encourage anyone to try this product as a cheaper alternative to the above acne solutions and recommend it to the minority of people that haven't had success with the big names."

The first week You don't really notice that much of a difference (although the cream starts drying up the existing blemishes from day 1)but after the first week or so the results are visible and after that blemishes really start to fade and I don't get breakouts nearly as often as before and when I do they're not as bad and only last for about a day because the cream makes them dry out over night.		I'm reaaally satisfied with the two part treatment from nature's cure. I even ran out of pills about a week ago (I just ordered more today) and the benzoyl cream has worked great on it's own.		P.S. I have tried severe acne treatment and it works (not as good as this) but it's a lot of work having to apply four different steps to times a day, it's really time consuming and for that reason you find yourself skiping the treatment once in a while.

The down side is acne - horrible in high school - still not great since - EVERY product, cure, herb, cream, pill, diet regimen, EVERY idea for curing acne pretty much on the planet earth, I have tried - hundreds, thousands of dollars....and no dice - everything works ok for a couple weeks, and then right back to baseline - infuriating doesn't begin to describe it, but it's more a resigned, depressed kind of fury at this point, after so much time.		THEN I found nature's cure a couple of years ago - I will agree with people that say it's kind of gimmicky, or ""kind of"" the same thing as other benzoil peroxide creams, and I will ALSO agree that the pills are kind of optional/ambiguously effective.		HOWEVER, the cream is the ONLY proper mixture of BOTH benzoil peroxide to dry the skin and THEN herbal moisturizers to keep the skin from needing to crank out more oil that I've ever found.  Every other benzoil peroxide cream dries the hell out of my skin, and by the end of the day I'm way MORE oily because my face is trying to compensate - I cannot use salicylic acid, as it makes me break out to an extreme, even horrifying degree.		Whatever the mixture in the nature's cure cream, it is the ONLY cream I've found in 15 years, of thousands of products, that finds the proper benzoil peroxide/natural moisturizer mix for a topical		I have coupled this with natural tea-tree oil soap, Dr. Bronner's, as my face wash, and for the first time in the last half of my life, my skin looks what I would call ""pretty ok""  ....I hope nature's cure never changes their formula, and is around for at least a few more decades, because I am a loyal fan at this point...

B0000535CI,2011,6,4.0,0,0,758,"Here's My Review","Since I just bought this product for a third time I thought it's about time I finally review it. First let me tell you about my acne experience. I've had acne for a very long time now and although it's not horrible it's very annoying and I usually get new acne every week. I've tried so many top products such as Proactive, Max Clarity, and Neutrogena. What I've noticed that one of four things happens when I use these products. It either makes my acne worse, irritates my skin, only gets rid of some of my acne, or just doesn't work at all. I've just about given up on acne products mainly because I just don't have the patience to use them. I'm happy to say that Nature Cure's Acne Treatment System could finally be the product that will cure my acne.		Let me first start out by saying this acne system isn't perfect, but I like it for a number of reasons.		-Easy-		With most acne products I've used I have to follow an annoying 3 step system that you have to do a few times a day and if your like me and your really impatient then you'll probably stop using them like I did. With Nature Cure it's a very simple 2 step system. You take a pill and use the cream twice a day (or more if you prefer). Since the bottle isn't very big and it's supposed to last a month I only use it at morning and night which works real nice with my routines (I use it right after I'm done brushing my teeth).		-The Pills-		The interesting thing about this is the pills. I've always just used stuff you apply to your face, but this was the first time I tried the pills out. The pills work as a way of keeping your body from causing you acne. You may not know this, but your diet is a big reason you get acne. I've had to cut down on some of the stuff I eat and thanks to these pills I've stopped getting new acne. I think it works just as well as the cream and it's very important if you want to prevent new acne from showing up.		-My Unfortunate Experience-		Let me first say that this product has came the closest to completely curing my acne which is why I continue to buy it and I think my acne would have been cured by now if it wasn't for my unfortunate experience. I was down to the last pills and cream and my acne was clearing up very nicely. Here's the problem. I ran out of it and my acne hadn't completely cured yet. I would have ordered more, but I was short on cash until I got my next check. Those couple weeks I waited to get some money and purchase another one of these was just long enough to cause all my acne that I worked so hard to get rid of to come back again. I was obviously pissed, but I'm not giving up. I have twelve days left on my second box and to prevent the same thing from happening again I ordered another box today, so when I run out of this one I can immediately start on the next box, so I don't get any new acne (I suggest you order a new box if you get to the second set of pills and your acne hasn't cleared up yet).		-My Final Thoughts-		This is a great acne system, but let me be clear that it is very slow. If your expecting this to work in one month then try another acne product because it will take longer than that to clear your acne. The reason why an impatient person like me is drawn to this product is because it is very easy to use and fits in with my morning and nightly routines perfectly. It doesn't dry out my skin, irritate it, and I usually see subtle results as the days pass. I hope that this will finally be the acne system to completely cure my acne and with my current results I think it might just be able to do it. With all of that said let me sum all this up with some pros and cons of this product.		-Pros: Very easy, doesn't irritate skin, doesn't dry out skin, prevents new acne from appearing		-Cons: Works slowly, bottle of cream is barely enough to last a month (use sparingly)"

After a year of prescriptions and recommendations from the doctor, my daughter (his mom) told me about this product. She used it as a teen and it worked great. He started on it the day he got it, and within 2 days we started seeing his face & back clear up. He ran out today and I am ordering more. NO side effects-- it's all natural. I will keep getting this as long as he needs it. Before when we took pictures his face was always red and blotchy, broken out. Now his face is clear. I tried to insert a picture but couldn't. I guess you'll have to take my word. He is smiling and acne is cleared up."
B0000535CI,2010,1,5.0,18,26,105,"The Best Acne Treatment Period","I don't have horrible acne but my forehead has always been oily and I get flair ups and get some natsty ones once in a while.  The last couple of years it's gotten slightly worse.  I've tried numerous things over the years.  Clearasil cream, pads, various 3 part systems, washing my face numerous times a day, etc.  Nothing worked.  I stumbled on this on sale tucked away in a bottom shelf at the store.  Thought I'd try it.  Taking the pills alone my skin has totally cleared up and I haven't had any blemishes.  This is one of the best homeopathic products I've ever used."
B0000535CI,2012,1,4.0,1,1,404,"Yeah, it works!","I break out heavily on my back when stressed; painful enough to cause problems when driving or carrying a backpack. Of course, it's also terribly unsightly, and knocks down one's self-esteem; especially when 30-something. I also had awful breakouts during puberty as well, despite how well I took care of my skin. My stepmother was an aestethician, and even she was frustrated with her inability to get things under control with her help. I have tried tons of OTC and Rx products, trust me! Now, everyone's bodies are different, so I cannot guarantee this product will work for you - but if you're tried plenty of other products with little to no success, then I suggest you give this a try.		This has a 5% Benzoyl Peroxide acne treatment in a bottle for your skin. That's good, but I can get 10% at my local drug store. I use it with a heavy-duty body brush, and cover the surface with the acne cream when showering - leaving the lather on long enough to soak into my pores, and kill the bacteria in my skin that causes problems. However, it doesn't last all day - especially if you're being active.		The other part, the all-natural pills -- they work! Again, they work for me. Within 2 weeks, my back was not breaking out nearly half as much, and those that did break out were smaller and less painful. Within a month, I have maybe one or two single breakouts, but they don't last as long, and the scars from prior to taking this are now starting to fade. If you can mix the acne medicine with 2% hydroquinone (a.k.a. 'Porcelana' in some drug stores) AFTER you shower, the fading will be faster and your skin tone more even. If you have the $60 or so extra to spare, see a dermatologist or go to a MedSpa, and have the nurse get you a 5% hydroquinone treatment. For about another $60, you can get that with .05% topical Retinol, even better - your skin will be smooth and natural again within 3-6 weeks.		For $10-$15 for 'Nature's Cure,' this is a great product, and I highly recommend it. I only wish they sold a version without the cream, so I could just buy a double-dose of tablets to last longer than 30 days. That's my only gripe, and admittedly, a tiny one.		Give it a try!"

When I saw this, I was intrigued by the fact that it's a pill, not a topical cream or wash. So, on a whim, I bought it. I expected it to be some bogus treatment just like everything else I've ever tried (I've been experimenting with acne treatment for years). I started taking the pills as directed, twice daily, and WOW. In only a few days I notice my skin clearing up. I've been using this for approximately two weeks now, and I am totally clear!!

B0000535CI,2010,2,5.0,7,10,547,"Not skeptical anymore!","I was looking for something to help my 15 year old son with his acne and read the reviews on this product. Knowing that hormones and genetic makeup have a lot to do with persistent skin problems, it only made sense to use a product that worked on both the inside (where they start) and the outside. The ingredients in the product were all perfectly harmless and the reviews were positive, but I also know that if something sounds too good to be true-it often isn't true. But the price was minimal and worth the risk.		We marked my son's ""start date"" on the calendar and tomorrow it will be two full weeks since that day. He and I both are totally AMAZED.	BEFORE Nature's Cure(NC):no matter what we tried topically, his skin was fairly ""bumpy"" even where no pimples had erupted, he would get 4 or 5 new ones a day, and at any given time he'd have 4 or 5 previous ones that he was trying to heal/dry out/deal with too.	AFTER NC:The first thing we both noticed was that the rate of new ones dropped drastically, I'd say about an 80% drop. The second thing we noticed was that the ones he was getting were FAR less severe and were healing much faster. After the first couple of days watching him (just in case he had any negative side effects from the tablets, which he did not)I forgot all about it. A couple of days ago he was talking to me face to face when I suddenly realized how GREAT his skin looked! My eyes widened and he stopped in the middle of a sentence and asked ""What?"" I grinned and said ""Can I touch your face?"" He grinned and said ""Yeah! It's cool huh?"" and I couldn't believe it! The ""bumps"" on the surface were totally gone and his skin was so SOFT and healthy looking.		Now, he STILL has some pimples, but they are random and small, and it hadn't even been two full weeks before there was a visible difference to others. (He had noticed long before I did because he obsesses about his face every day) And maybe I'm just imagining this part-but I'd SWEAR that the tablets, which are supposed to help counteract the stressful hormones that cause acne, have improved his moodiness! Not a whole lot mind you, and maybe it's just that his self-confidence is improving as his skin does, but he's been more easy going and less snippy at his siblings than usual. Either way I'm SO thankful for this product and my son has already asked me to reorder it so he doesn't run out.		VERY impressed, and VERY satisfied.		UPDATE- 2/18/2011		My son ran out of this and literally pestered me into ordering him some more. It came quickly and he is enjoying the same results as before. He did say that he noticed much better results when he used both products together rather than when he forgot to take the pills but used the cream alone. Not only that, but upon re-reading my first review, I'm seeing the same improvement in his moodiness (when he's using the product)that I noted before. Could be entirely coincidental or self-esteem related-but either way-it's a good thing."

The only way I found out about this product was at Rite-Aid with 1 bottle of the Body spray. It seemed to be working ok, and I did a search on Amazon.com for it, and seen all the great reviews. So for $10, I was like why not?  Man am I glad I did. Amazing stuff, I noticed a difference after 2 or 3 days, then 1 week was even better, 2 weeks was more and going a month strong, almost completely clear, if I do get any breakouts, gone in a day almost. Strongly recommended for anybody who has gone to a Dermatoligist for years (i'm 28, been going since I was 13). Tried Retina, tretinoin, differin, all topicals, oral prescripts. Proactiv and others over the counter. I use Neutrogena Adavanced Solutions facewash and spf15 lotion, the acne lotion worked, but not as good as natures cure lotion.(almost the same, but natures cure has twice the benzoyl peroxide and additional aloe for cooling) with Natures Cure 2 step process.

Those just burned my face. I don't know how people can keep using those, all those steps, and the pain. This two-part system is basically a pill in the morning, a pill at night, and the lotion in the morning. I think you can use the lotion at night, too but I found that it dried up my face, so I only use it when I wake up. The great thing is, it's not greasy or anything. Put it on and voila, it's done, it basically just disappears. I have a monthly supply of this, and I can only recall getting two pimples since. Seriously, this thing WORKS. Honestly, guys, there are a lot of crap out there, but this thing actually works. It was like a Godsend. And for the cheap price? Awesome. The only issues I've had is with the sellers -- one guy sent me a box WITHOUT the lotion, while another guy sent me a box WITHOUT the pills. Weird. Anyways, in terms of working? Yeah, this works for guys, and this is coming from someone who has always had acne problem since he was a teen and i'm in my '30s now. No more, baby, no more!"

Mine were definitely hormone-related, i.e., I always seemed to breakout around my time of the month.  I've been on the pill; that helped to an extent.  But not enough--and I've been off it a few years now.  I do have to add that I switched from liquid drug-store make-up to mineral make-up, and that has helped tremendously.  However, I was still breaking out on occassion, and it was unsightly and embarrassing.  I tried Pro-activ with great hope, but the product didn't work.  I tried other acne kits (mostly from Walmart), such as Neutrogena (I usually love their products), but nothing worked.  I even used a sample of a prescription product, but no change. Then, I saw Nature's Cure on the shelf.  I figured, what the heck, I've tried everything else, and for under $10, it was worth a shot.		The acne cream can be a bit irritating to your skin at first--I even got a small, dry, peeling area on my chin from it.  But, I started using it less often and that helped.  I now use it as needed, and can use it often, as my skin has seemed to have ""gotten used to it.""  And the pills--WONDERFUL!!  These pills have no side effects, and my skin looks great because of them.  If I even get a pimple, it's usually small and clears up quickly.  I rarely see breakouts anymore, and if I do, they're not much (just up the use of the cream).  My skin feels smoother and seems healthier.  I absolutely LOVE this stuff!  So here I am, ordering it from Amazon, because now I can't find it anywhere!  Sometimes Rite-Aid will have it, sometimes not.  Walmart doesn't carry it anymore.  I don't know why.  Maybe not enough people are giving this product a shot....and they really should.  There is nothing more frustrating than having to go on a quest for a product that you love and know works well.  And with the cost of Nature's Cure, I can't think of anything more perfect than effectiveness combined with value.  I'll be a customer for life, as long as I can find it!"

I wouldnt say that it just totally cures acne, but if you have some hormonal reasons that may be causing some acne, then this is definitely worth a try for you. I take them every day, and if I run out, I NOTICE. It not only helps acne, but really makes your skin look nicer in general. I love it. The cream included in the box is just like every other bez. peroxide cream out there, so its nothing special, but effective as usual.  I also take a biotin and a guggulsterone supplement with this.

I tried so many other things such as proactive, accutane, and other doctor prescribed acne medicines and nothing has worked. I do not use the cream part of Natures Cure but I do use the pills. I like them because they are tasteless and you don't have to take them at the exact same time each day, and if you forget one... it'so okay. I have reccomended this product to several other people who have also had success with it. It is not a product that you can expect to see results over night from, but give it a month or so and you might be surprised. The down fall to this product for me, is that if I stop using it for a few months my acne comes back but, $10/month is a low price to pay for confidence. So, if you're one of those people who can't find anything to cure acne or reduce it's severity I would definitely try natures cure... and don't worry about the cream, I would suggest only using it if you absolutely need to. Natures cure also makes a face wash system which works great paired with the pills but, it is not a necessity."

Like everyone else has said the cream is very harsh but I use it when my face still feels oily or greasy after washing it or on pimples I still have. It drys them up fast and stops them from getting worse. This product is a few dollars cheaper at walmart than here and I'm glad to say they finally brought it back recently.

This literally cleared his face up within 2 days.He doesn't use the cream because it's harsh. If he uses it, he says he breaks out more (it does dry the skin and as a way to bring moisture back to the surface, the skin will get oily, which can cause breakouts...it's a cycle...only use the cream sparingly on big sores...don't smear it all over your face) His face looks so nice now. I started using this product as well because right before my period, I sometimes break out (mildly) and this makes my skin very clear and smooth. I also do not really use the cream.

For me, the problem never got worse before it got better. It worked in about a week and though i still have scars from previous breakouts, I'm not nearly as embarrassed to wear little or no make-up when I leave the house. I usually clean my face with Witch Hazel at night and apply the cream when needed and take the pills as directed. I haven't broke out once and I am down to the last few pills.

Nothing worked, Proactive, any of the drug store brand of washes/cleansers/systems. I remembered that I had used this awhile back but had to stop because it severely dried out my skin. I decided to try it out again. It's only been 4 days and my acne is almost completely gone and what is left looks like it will be gone soon and no new break outs. I'm using this with Garnier gel-cream moisturizer and so far it seems to be helping to keep the Vanishing cream that comes in this package from drying out my skin. As for the pills, I was worried they'd taste horrible (you're supposed to chew them) but they're not even chalky and don't taste like anything.

Every month I would get a very large blemish (about the size and height of a pencil eraser) on my chin.  I tried many over the counter products (including proactive) to no avail.  I even went to a fancy-pants skin renewal dermatology clinic.  They advertised lasers and all types of ways to cure acne but when they saw me, the basically said that my acne was hormonal and shrugged their shoulders and said the lasers and other treatments they had wouldn't work on hormonal acne.  At this point, I was getting two very large blemishes a month and so my skin was always either broken out or red from healing.  The derm clinic did recommend using an adult acne treatment kit from dermalogica.  This helped little to none.  Anyway, saw the nature's cure at Walgreens and it caught my eye because it was for women and since I knew my acne was hormonal I figured it was worth a try but didn't really believe it would.  I was amazed!  I have not had a blemish since I started using this product at the end of October!!!  I am so pleased with this product.  I don't even use the cream, just the pills (one every morning and night.)  I would recommend this to anyone, especially someone in their 30's or 40's who has hormonal acne.  Nature's Cure has far exceeded my expectations.  I continue to use the dermalogica, Bare Essentials mineral makeup, and Nature's Cure daily and have found this combination to be the perfect combination that has kept me blemish free for four months.

I have tried dozens of over the counter products and several prescriptions including Accutane. This works better than 95% of everything else I have tried. My face seems to be clearing up a lot in general and when I do get a pimple it is much smaller and quicker to heal then it has before using this product.

I have tried EVERYTHING for cystic acne: expensive Beverly Hills dermatologists, antibiotics, pro-activ, MaxClarity, Mario Badescu, pretty much any and every over-the-counter and prescription medicine - internal and external.  I had gotten to the point where NOTHING worked and I was relying on cortisone injections at the dermatologist to try to keep it under control, which is pricey and painful.	I finally ordered a Blue light lamp from Trophy Skin, which didn't do anything for me.  HOWEVER, they also included Nature's Cure for Females - 2 part system. I put it aside and thought that if my hardcore prescription drugs couldn't control it, then these homeopathic pills could not either. I WAS WRONG!	The day after I used the topical and began the pills, I could feel my very broken out chin starting to heal. I tried not to get hopeful because I have been let down so many times....BUT within 1 week, my face was clear of any new blemishes and all existing blemishes were nearly healed. Since that time (about 3 weeks ago) my face is 100% clear and I have no new cysts or breakouts AT ALL.  I don't know how it works but I don't care! I am so relieved and optimistic that I really found something. I say try it - for $10 it is worth it and there are no words to describe what it feels like to have clear skin - even during that time of the month - I could cry with happiness."

That being said- I do want to address some things I see in negative reviews- and a few in positive.		Some say they don't see a change, others say they do- I've always seen a change with CONSISTENT use. I mean to say its like the Pill- don't expect to take it day one and expect it to work full blast, it takes time to build up and make a change. I'd say month two of use, you should definitely start seeing something. It's a regulating pill, it helps your body, it isn't throwing chemicals in there to force your body to change, so its going to take a while.		As for the cream, I myself have never had good luck with the cream. I do blame that on the fact that I have dermatitis so I'm allergic to several different things that affect my skin topically- whenever I'd put on the cream it would instantly become red and swollen and abominably itchy all over the area I had applied it- basically my face. Swollen like you wouldn't believe. So if that happens to you- blame less the product, and make sure you don't have a skin condition like I did. I never dabbed it on like some people say they did, so it also could have been misuse.		This product is a dream. It doesn't mess with you, it is cheap and affordable to upkeep. I have tried SO MANY acne products out there, and none have given me such tried and true results as Nature's Cure. They have one for bacne too, which I've never had to use, but I'd trust it also."

But wanting to start a family, I had to forego the birth control and back came the breakouts! I tried EVERY cream and product on the shelf.  I steered clear of this product because I really didn't want to add yet another pill to my daily routine but I was desperate.  It's been about 2.5 weeks and I am seeing a HUGE difference in my skin. YAY!!!! I give this product 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone trying to clear up their face. FWIW, this isn't only for teens, I am 33. Cheers to clear skin!!!"

I had zero improvement.  The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the product is fairly priced, it didn't make my acne worse, and when you have acne it is worth it to try out.  I have had total success since with both Proactiv and University Medical's product Acne Free.  Good luck!"

B0000535CH,2012,9,5.0,1,1,307,"GREAT PRODUCT!","My skin has always been pretty clear, but about 3 months ago i started getting deep cystic acne bumps that came out of no where. The whole left side of my face had about 6 deep huge pimples on it at one time, it looked terrible! I could not get rid of them and they hurt so bad. Ive always used face wash and an exfoliator and then benzoyle peroxide (10%) at night. So when I started getting these pimples I knew it had to have been hormonal cause ive always had pretty good skin. Now, let me say that this system is not an overnight fix to acne. I've been taking this product faithfully (one pill in the morning and one at night before bed) for 2 weeks straight now, and I have seen a pretty good improvement in the scars left by these pimples. In saying that, even a week after being on the pills I was still getting a few cystic bumps, however now, 2 weeks into it, I can see that I am getting less and less and my skin is looking a whole lot clearer! I also use the BP cream that comes in the kit its 5%, and I put it on under my makeup in the mornings. I just started doing this recently, but I feel like it fights pimples having it under my makeup during the day. The cream is a little drying, so I put alot of moisturizer over the cream and then put on my makeup. Im really glad they came up with this system!! I really believe it works. But again, its not an overnight fix. it will take anywhere from 2 weeks to a month to see any improvment, but it is WORTH the wait. I hope it works for everyone else struggling with acne."

I would recommmend this product with no hesitation. It works and is very reasonably priced.  Thanks, Nature's Cure!"
B0000535CH,2012,3,5.0,1,1,213,"Nature's Cure is the bomb!","I've been using this product for years and I swear by it.  I've had adult acne on and off my entire adult life and when it flares up, it's far worse than my teenage acne EVER was.  Nature's Cure reduces the number of flareups and dramatically reduces the severity of them.		I have only one complaint and one suggestion to them:  the complaint is that it's no longer available in brick and mortar stores anywhere I or anyone I know lives (5 states!), even though the website says it's available in MANY stores.  The company has either pulled that distribution or instituted some policy that makes brick and mortar stores not want to deal with them anymore.  Whatever they did that made stores stop carrying it, they need to UNDO.  This ticks me off so badly that if there was any other alternative that actually worked and was price competitive, I'd go with it.  The suggestion is that they either offer an alternative of the tablets without the cream or reduce the size of the cream tube.  I have at least 30 of those tubes of cream now and I really don't need any more!		I will be using this product for as long as they make it....and I hope that is forever!"

I couldn't figure out why so I cut out a lot of dairy in my diet and I was still breaking out. I was using regular facewash and it didn't help much. So, I decided to try Nature's Cure because I have a relative who tried it and it worked very well for him. I figure why not, it seemed affordable enough. I started taking the tablets and just after two weeks my face started clearing up. It started eliminating my breakouts, and the reddening of swelling of the acne. I was amazed. The vanishing cream was a bit too strong for my face, so I use adult acne cream by clearisil instead because it helps with adult's sensitive skin. However, I can say that the tablets worked wonders for me. I don't suffer breakouts everyday I used to. It also says you should chew the tablet for better results, which I do and chewing it is fine because the tablets doesn't really have a flavor to it. Overall, I'm glad I tried this product and wanted to add to the reviews to let you all know it worked for me :)"

B0000535CH,2009,4,1.0,10,18,594,"1 Part Science, 1 Part Hocus Pocus","This product contains two things, as stated on the package. Pills, and a cream.		The creme contains a 5% Benzoyl Peroxide mixture, which is similar, if not exactly like, about 50% of all acne treatments. Acne treatments work using either a 2.5%, 5.0%, or 10% Benzoyl Peroxide mix, or, a Salicylic  Acid mix. BP works by directly killing acne bacteria and increasing skin turnover rate, which means the pores get clogged less. Salicylic acid works by actively removing epidermis cells, which again decreases clogging of pores, as well as decreasing inflammation, since Acetylsalicylic acid is what we call Aspirin, and decreases pain and inflammation.		Basically, either of those two ingredients work for scientific reasons. The cream included in the Natures Cure package contains an ingredient that works, period.		The pills however, are pure insanity. Homeopathic medicine is probably the biggest medicinal fraud on Earth, even more so than magnetic bracelets or thinking that getting sick is caused by ""bad blood,"" as was thought hundreds of years ago.		For those that don't know what it is, homeopathy states that to cure something, you have to introduce into the body something that produces similar ailments. If you have a headache, you should take something that gives you a headache. So they test things. Does taking arsenic give you a headache? It does? Then you'd better take some of that. Sound crazy? You don't know the half of it. Homeopathics think that in order for the like+like=cured effect to take place, the item must be diluted. This is what those ""12x"" and ""30x"" numbers mean. Here's how dilution works for them:		If you take one part of an item, say...""Echinacea angustifolia (cone flower)"" as is in these pills, and mix it with 9 parts water, you will have Echinacea angustifolia (cone flower) 1x. Now take one part of that mixture and mix it with 9 parts water. This is 2x. At this point, there is 1 part of the original ingredient and 99 parts water. Do it again, 3x. And again, 4x. So on. We get to Echinacea angustifolia (cone flower) 12x, which is what these pills contain. If you know math, then you have already figured out that this is 1 part Cone Flower to 10,000,000,000,000 parts water. That's 10 trillion parts water.		10 TRILLION parts water, 1 part cone flower. If they started with tablespoons, as in, 1 tablespoon cone flower and 9 tablespoons water, you would now have 1 tablespoon of cone flower in 39,062,500,000 gallons of water. This is almost as much water as the ENTIRE United States uses every day. Sprinklers, drinking water, toilets, everything across the country. If we took all that water and put a tablespoon of cone flower in it, how big of a difference would it make?		Now here's the big thing. At around 23-26x, it is doubtful that your current ""1 part of the previous mix with 9 parts water concoction"" would contain even a single molecule from the original. Every time you mix again, you reduce that chance by 90%. Now look at the ingredients to the pills. ""Hepar Sulfuris Calcareum (calcium sulfide) 24x, Carbo Vegetabilis (vegetable carbon) 30x, Cimifuga racemosa (black cohosh) 30x, Graphites (graphite) 30x."" I would be willing to bet all the money I'd ever make in my life that these pills do not contain an ATOM of the ingredients listed here.		Don't be fooled. Like one customer said, the pills tasted like nothing. Guess why?		You can buy similar creams for $2. Homeopathic medicine is trash and this product is as well."

It is important for you to know that if you want to try this product, you should buy two of them at first!!!

First Two Weeks-I began to see the blemishes I did have clearing up a lot faster than they normally do. I have never really used the gel that comes with the pills, except during these first two weeks I would put a thin layer on my chin.		Within the First Month- I wanted to say I saw a dramatic change in my skin, but I wasn't sure yet if this was just my skin's normal cycle of clearing up before it came ""that time of the month"" again.		Second Month & Beyond- This stuff REALLY works!!! I will still get the very occasional zit, but they are HARDLY noticeable. Even when it comes to the week before my period, I will maybe get one small teeny tiny cyst (if that!) that is hardly even noticeable, whereas my chin would have a number of zits every time I had my period before Nature's Cure.

Just leave the package out where you can always see it and it helps me remember. Good luck!"

I LOVE t his product & would recommend it to anyone who has bad acne, & think it's due to hormones. I know mine was, because when I took Orthotrycyclen birth control pills I didn't have acne, & that birth control pill helps acne. I HOPE THIS NEVER GOES OFF THE MARKET!!"

B0000535CH,2012,7,4.0,0,0,216,"Nature's Cure for women","I am a 25 year old female, and I've been battling acne since I was probably 10.  Since I was a teen, I've used Proactiv.  It always worked well for me, but it gets pretty expensive.  I decided to give Nature's Cure a try.  It seems like a lot of the other reviewers are calling this product a miracle and your skin is magically clear.  Well, after using it for about a month now, I can say this product was not a ""miracle"" for me.  My skin is clearer, but I still have acne, it's just not as bad.  However, that being said, I will continue to use this product for one reason:  Every month, a week or so before my period, I always get big cystic pimples.  Mostly on my back, but also on my face.  I'm due for my period any day now, and I have yet to have any cystic acne pop up on my back and face.  Since cystic acne is caused by excess oil buildup from hormonal imbalances caused by your period, I'm confident that the Nature's Cure tablets are keeping my oil production in check, especially around the time of my period.		So, in summary, Nature's Cure isn't giving me beautiful flawless skin, but it is helping with period-related acne."
B0000535CH,2012,7,4.0,0,0,144,"Actually Works!!","Before I used this, I had forehead acne, mostly due to hormones (I'm 18). They came up big and hurt a lot, but this actually helped it clear up! It didn't really start working until the 3rd week, and now my skin is totally clear from those cystic pimples. I still have blackheads though, but those aren't that bad. I have yet to use this during my period, so I'm not sure if that'll help it or not. I recommend this to those who have tried everything from cleansers, to acne packs, but aren't having any luck. Acne is really due to the fluctuations of your hormones, especially if you're in your teenager years. This is pretty cheap. The only thing that stinks is the cream, because I don't even use half of it, yet every month I will be getting a new tube."

Nature's Cure however.. perfect.		Like a few others who have reviewed this product, the problem will get worse before it gets better. This is because the medication from the pills and creams literally brings all the dirt and oils to the surface, then cleanses them away. After that, say goodbye for good! Just remember to take this in the morning and at night, I keep it next to my alarm clock and take it when I first wake up, and then at night when I set my alarm for the next day.		Don't waste money on Proactive, Nature's Cure doesn't need to put makeup on their models for the ""after"" shots. :)		Best of luck on your skin journey! Don't forget to keep moisturizing too!"

It also causes itches on your ears and nose."

I never saw improvement on my skin from taking these pills. I am surprised that I stuck to this homeopathic product for a good 6 months. I think I gave this product a fair chance. This just did NOT do anything for me. This goes to show not every product works the same for everyone, but I can see it works for some people.		At this point, what works the best for my skin is BC pills, vitamins and herbal tea. I started taking all that after I found out the root cause of my breakouts. My doc told me my t-levels were a little high for a female. High t-levels in a woman = hormone imbalance. If you are a woman with adult acne, get your hormones checked and find out if that is the root cause."

The pills, literally, taste like nothing, which threw me the first couple of times, but now I'm used to it.  The cream did make the areas red (where I applied it), but that went away after a couple of days.  You do have to watch out for dryness, but that's nothing a good moisterizer can't fix.

As with any homeopathic medicine, the problem gets worse before it gets better. This means that I am now seeing pimples where I never have seen before, such as on my pulse and upper ear lobe.		Because it is homeopathic and because new pimples are showing up I know it is being effective since it is now making my body get rid of the bad stuff that was causing the acne, opening up the path for the cure.

I'm an African American woman in my late twenties and I've had acne prone skin since about 19.  I've tried Proactive, Murad and a host of other acne treatments, but none of them worked for me. Now after 6 months of using Nature's Cure, my face is acne free and almost completely clear of dark spots. I stretched my supply out to 2 months, so I'm sure if you used it as prescribed, you'd see even better results than I experienced. This product is easy to use and reasonably priced.

I've always had a great complexion so I was very upset when- in my late 20s - when all these worries are supposed to be OVER with - I start getting the worst acne in my life. It was sore and nothing would make it heal. I tried a number of topical treatments but nothing helped. As soon as one of the large bumps would begin to shrink another one or two would begin to grow. I was considering taking my chances and seeing a dermatologist for a cortisone shot to the face and taking my chances with the terrible effects that can have - then I stumbled upon this product.		I've never even opened the cream. The pills worked WONDERS on my face. Since I started taking them, my face cleared up and I've not had a single outbreak. It was crazy how fast it worked after nothing else would. I still get minor little pimpels but the hormal cyst stuff is gone and for that, I am completely in love with this product!!!!!!"

I have hormonal acne and I usually get about 2-3 pimple/nodules a week and that flares up even more a week before I get my period. I decided it was time to change and after seeing all the side effects of the other pills I decided I'd give these Natural pills a try.		*I read over all of the reviews and saw that most people had great success with these pills so I decided to give it a shot. Everyone is different so I expected to be disappointed when they didn't work. After about 2 weeks of taking 1 pill in the morning and 1 pill at night I honestly didn't think i would see any results. BUT I DID ! I'm not even done with my 1st month's supply yet & I already ordered 2 more!!! I haven't gotten any nodules or pimples since I started this treatment. I am ESPECIALLY IMPRESSED because usually I get 3 or more pimples before & during my menstruation....but NOTHING !		-I got 1 pimple right after I got my period but I took the pill that night and used some of the treatment cream on it before bed & the next morning there was NOTHING THERE!		TRUST ME I have used EVERYTHING BEFORE : Neutrogena Skin ID, Proactive, Clearsil, Clean and Clear, Noxema....EVERYTHING and nothing worked...or it just WASNT ENOUGH.		I've had great success with these pills, but there are a few things you should keep in mind:		I saw results after 2 weeks and I didn't change my diet (even though I should), I've been drinking alcohol and going to sleep late at night and I've still seen results !		* Also in addition to taking these pills I still used 1 Neutrogena Acne Face Wash in the morning and a Neutrogena Naturals Make Up Remover was at night.  However...I was using these before and it wasn't enough so the pills are really making a change !

Lamer The Eye Balm is $140 VS Roc Correxion Eye Cream $14 (Amazon).  (both are 0.5 oz)  I love Lamer but I also love Roc eye cream about the same.  Only that I can buy 10 Roc instead of 1 Lamer.  I use eye cream since I turn 20 and now has been 15 years of prevention.  I careless about face and body cream but I do careful about my eyes.  I never miss a night putting on eye cream.

It's lightly moisturizing and works well under make-up. I think I am beginning to see the effects under my eyes. They are appearing to lighten up. I say lighten up as in skin thickening not lightening discoloration ~ my darkness is from thinning under the lids due to aging not hyper-pigmentation. Also, I wanted to use it as a prep for the retin-a micro I just received in order to prevent the dryness wrinkles. However, I do not use it on the upper lids because it is my understanding that no retinol type product should be used there. I am a licensed aesthetician and just wanted to get that FYI out there because I did read that some of the reviewers were doing that. You might want to ask your doc."

My older sister however, has been into the whole world of wrinkle prevention since she was like 15 and it shows (everyone thinks she's my little sister and she's 3 years older).  So I called her and this is the stuff she recommended. She also recommended the face cream by the same manufacturer.  The only thing she said is to make sure you never go out in the sun with this on your face because of the retinol.  Anyway, I started using it and I have to say I really like it. It has exceeded my expectations and has actually begun to smooth some of the wrinkles I already had.  Also, it doesn't smell like perfume so that's always a plus.

I won't say that they didn't work but I can barely see any difference. Until one day I found this ROC eye cream(They carry another eye cream but it doesn't work as well as this one). Originally, I don't have a lot of confidence in drug store products but since it's in a reasonable price, I decided to give it a shot.

I stuck with it, though, and now I won't quit! I will also mention that this is the only ROC product I have used that does not have fragrance--this is very important to me since I have eczema and sensitive skin. I actually use the eye product on other parts of my face, too. This is the best price you will find anywhere--especially on subscribe and save. I'm ordering here at Amazon now after spending way too much at the drugstore on this same product. I was kind of disappointed to see some low reviews here and did not feel they were justified.

I bought the ROC product first. I followed all the directions and used it every day. I saw no change at all, even after six weeks of use. Then I got the Garnier product. It seemed to work somewhat. When I got the trial size Clinique product, I used the Garnier on one eye and the Clinique on the other, just to see which product worked better. The Garnier worked better, the puffiness wasn't nearly as bad, though the circles were still dark.		While on shopping trip at Ulta, looking for eye makeup remover, I stumbled on the L'Oreal product. It was around $12 and I had a 50% off of any product coupon. I've been using it on one eye with the Garnier on the other for two weeks. The Garnier was thrown in the drawer with the other failures. The L'Oreal product works. After two weeks, the darkness has faded, the small lines at the corners of my eyes have lessened and within 30 minutes of use, the puffiness is almost non-existent."

I can only imagine the increase in progress i will see with time. MY ONLY PROBLEM with the product is the packaging.

I think there would have been a greater difference if I had corrected my sleeping habits and applied the lotion twice a day instead of just when I go to sleep. This product however is by far the cheapest solution to dark eye circles and unlike most other product it can be easily obtained at a local drug store.

B0009RFB76,2011,6,5.0,11,11,481,"Got rid of puffiness and it tightened my skin ~ I'm impressed","I bought the ROC winkle face cream at Costco and it came with this free sample of ROC Retinol Correction Eye Cream .5-ounce tube.  Sure, another glorified eye cream I thought.  I didn't use it but used the wrinkle cream on my chin area (that shows my worst sun damage with fine wrinkles starting) and it was okay...didn't reverse the damage or change the skin texture.		I then tried the ROC eye cream a couple days ago because I couldn't find my expensive eye cream tube.  I have one fine line of a crow's foot starting on my right eye, but my main concern is swelling and puffiness on my upper and lower lids which nothing helped.  The first 2 days I couldn't figure out what was happening, my eyes were looking different but I was too busy to find out what was different.  Today I gave myself a facial with the Clarisonic, worked around my eyes and neck, used dermabrasion and then applied the ROC Eye Cream.  That was it!!!  My bags and puffiness were disappearing, almost non-existent!  I feel a tightness around my eyes now - in just a few days! I can't wait for longer testing to see if it holds up or if it's a fluke.  I'm skeptical about beauty claims, being a Cosmetologist in California, I have seen many snake-oil products come and go.		This isn't a heavy cream, more of a rich, liquidy lotion...it's easily smoothed onto the eye area without pulling of the skin.  I use it on the outer corners and smooth it under my eyes to my nose, then put more above my eyes from eyebrow to eyelash and onto my upper nose/eyebrow area...like a raccoon mask.  A little seems to go a long way.  I keep my tube in a drawer standing upright - as one reviewer said it's liquidy and it sometimes oozes into the lid if lying down, could be a heat issue as it's been hot here and I just started using this product.  I can say NOTHING else I have tried made such a fast impact as this ROC has on my eyes.  I use it morning and night and it's not too strong for my oily, Italian, fair complexion with rosacea.  If someone finds it too strong, just dab some water around your eyes before applying a small amount and see if that helps lessen the strength of it.  I have sensitive skin and so far I'm okay with the face and eye cream from ROC, even tho' the face cream has a strong scent to it, the eye cream is more neutral.		I give this 5 stars just for the amazing effect it had on my eyes.  Everyone is different and what works for some may not work on others.  I'll report back in a month and see if I still agree with this review."

Unlike other RoC products, this one doesn't sting at all, so I use it all around my eyes even on eyelids. It's that gentle. Also, it spreads easily, and is not oily or sticky.

I am using Roc on 1 eye and Neutrogena Ageless Intensives deep wrinkle eye cream on the other.  I like the consistency of the Neutrogena but also no help with the wrinkles.

B0009RFB76,2009,1,1.0,6,10,110,"Careful - it burns","I have tried a lot of products for eye cream and have come to the conclusion that a good, heavy face cream is just as good. Roc seems to have a lot of ""let's do the whole dermabrasion without the clinic visit"" to it that just does not seem to be a good idea. I actually get puffier using this product as well as the face products than I would with a good face cream. If you want to use this as a good exfoliant - that's ok. Just do it once a week - otherwise you'll be all peeling and flaking - and puffy. Try Rachel Perry. Much better."

If 1 is Michael Jackson black (post-2000), and 10 is Lil Wayne black, my dark circles went from a 5 (Carl Weathers) to a 3 (Beyonce black)... why choose this cream over others? it definitely kind of works... the consistency makes it very smooth and easy to apply... also it doesn't irritate your eyes, which is definitely a plus.

I don't believe any products can create miracles, that's why I didn't fall for expensive brand name eye treatment. After doing some research on the internet, hyaluronic acid and ceramides, retinol, neuropeptides, vitamin C and E, etc were found to be important ingredient for anti-aging eye cream. However, debates over whether these are real effects or just placebo are still very hot..		I bought this product to give it a try mainly because of affordability. After using it for about a week, my office mate did notice my dark circles faded a little, but I also had some good night sleep as well. I would rather believe it is a combination effect.		I didn't have any bad reactions to the cream, but I only use it at bed time since it is known that retinol will increase skin sensitivity with sunlight.		After all, I think this eye cream will help, but nothing dramatic; healthy life style, diet and plenty of rest are more important. In the long run, I think it should be beneficial comparing to using nothing at all. If you want instant results, I recommend surgery."

I purchased this twice, but I'm not 100% sure why I bought it a second time.  I guess it's because I knew it wasn't really bad, but it's just not good.		The product is very light and smooth feeling, and does make the eye area feel moisturized, but I see no improvement that couldn't be done with any other moisturizer.  Then again, I'm only in my early twenties, so maybe this is the reason I'm not seeing anything special happening.  I did use it daily for about a year, but now I only use it occasionally when I remember I have it, because I need to finish this second bottle so I don't feel like I wasted my $20 or so.		Speaking of the packaging, the container as a whole is awful.  It's a metal/foil type of container underneath the white labeling. The labeling is a weird sticky material that for some reason likes to wear away and stick to everything in my makeup bag, and the metal likes to break very easily if it gets bent and spill out the product.  I have been a lot more careful with this second bottle since I knew this happens, but I'm still having issues.		Overall, I wouldn't recommend this eye cream, because it's been nothing special for me."

The 2nd step, it does burn my daughter's face though. I am not sure if toners do that though, and it does go away quickly. Maybe it is an allergic reaction?

B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,3.0,3,4,317,"Not for me... but it might work for you....","I wanted to like this acne treatment system, as it had a lot of features going for it:	- I like the 3 step system.	--- Step 1 is washing with the cleanser (used like soap) to remove oil and dirt	--- Step 2 is called the ""Calming Toner"" is wiped on with cotton or a cosmetic pad and provides further cleaning of pores while at the same time soothing the skin	--- Step 3 is a cream that is absorbed into the skin to kill acne causing bacteria, but also provide moisture.		- The ingredients seem high quality.		- The components each behave well when applied: The Cleanser washes off easily, the Toner absorbs/evaporates quickly, and the cream absorbs readily.		- I like the scents: Pleasantly floral, but not too feminine.		The instructions include the warning that you may need to ""ease into"" using the cream as it may cause dry skin.  I did find that I experienceds some irritation when using the cream, but it was only brief and did not ultimately seem to dry out my skin.		So why only 3 stars?  Well for all its benefits, it did not seem to adequately control break-outs for me.  I do not have a serious acne problem, but rather suffer from occasional blemishes .  After using this system for a week I did not see any diminishment in the frequency or severity of these break-outs.  I may actually have noticed an increase in frequency, which I think may be attributable to the cream (step 3) which although moisturizing may also be clogging my pores.  I will continue to try the system with only steps 1 and 2.		In conclusion I think this is a high quality system, but it did not work for me.  Everyone's skin and reactions are different though, so if you are willing to give it a try it may be worth it."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,1.0,5,7,374,"Hard to Believe It's Organic","Before I explain my one-star rating, allow me to share some background:		1) I have extremely fair skin; I use SPF45 (waterproof & sweatproof) year-round, and I still get sunburned now and then, even with all my precautions. (The pic in my Amazon profile is the closest I will ever get to a tan.)		2) For the most part, I have always had good skin, until I had my first child -- I've had more outbreaks in the past three years, than all my teen years combined.  My acne is definitely at the mercy of my post-pregnancy hormones.		3) My main problem is blackheads (which I usually just use Biore strips for), and I've never had to deal with some of the more extreme problems you see in dermatologist commercials.		4) I am only allergic to latex (i.e. balloons, gloves, etc.); I have no other allergies. I am not allergic to any of the ingredients listed on the product; I have used similar products in the past with no problems.		I used this product for the first time last night. I read the directions-for-use very carefully, and followed them precisely.  I was not using anything else; I didn't scrub my face.  Again, I followed the instructions to the tiniest detail.		First I washed with the cleanser; I didn't feel anything, and I didn't see any changes to my skin (I didn't expect any immediate results).  I used the toner next; it smelled great, but I noticed a tingling sensation in my skin...still no cause for alarm.		However, after I used the lotion (and I used a tiny amount for a ""thin"" layer just as the directions instructed), my face felt like it was on fire! I tried to rinse the stuff off with plain water, and I was left looking like a chemical-burn victim...it's drastic.		I have absolutely no idea why that happened, but I will not be using this product ever again.  Maybe it would work for some people, but at this point, I would not recommend it for anyone else with fair skin.  I gave it one-star because this morning my face still looks like it's been burned.  I feel much safer using natural products like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3R7O"">Burt's Bees Natural Remedy Kit</a>."

The active ingredient in this product is the same as in most anti-acne products, salicylic acid.  If that doens't work for you in other medications, the addition of the ""certified organic botanical"" Oligopeptide-10 certainly isn't going to change much.		This worked for me.  I have mild to moderately oily skin.  I had fairly severe acne as a teen, but it improved with age and I now have mild acne in my mid-thirties.		The smell is more pleasent than most astringents but a little too sweet for me.  Still, it works nicely when used daily (I only use it once a day where the instructions say to use it twice).  I'm not sure why some reviewers complain of the time it takes to use the product as it is quick and mess free for me.		So, I offer it 4 stars as an average; a 5 because it works for me, and a 3 because it isn't going to work for everyone, no matter what the manufacturer suggests.  Fair?		Good luck!"

While not suffering from acne, this treatment excels as a deep cleanser for the face.  It seems to make the skin smoother and softer.		As far as acne goes - I don't think there will ever be a single solution for everyone.  The likely cause of acne is infection of the sebaceous glands and effects, most often, adolescents as their hormones may be imbalanced more frequently.  Any type of medication may help deep cleanse the pores (and kill bacteria), but as long as the glands are conductive for the growth of bacteria (imbalance), the acne will return.		At any rate, this truly is a ""full treatment,"" as the box has a cleanser, a toner, and a lotion.  This is not just an organic version of some Oxy or Stridex pad.		I did have to take one star away because, while none of the description or text on the box says so, there was a sticker put on the box that says something along the lines of ""Clinically proven to have less acne is 6 weeks.""  Six weeks?  That seems like a tremendous amount of time to not include in any sales literature.		As for the product itself - would definitely recommend."

I have been using this product for about 6 weeks now and saw a result within the first few weeks of using it.  I have been faithfully using the product as directed, using all three parts of the kit twice a day.  Following that regimen, I found that it definitely reduced the oiliness and outbreaks on my forehead and chin.  Even more dramatically, though, it has evened out the skin tone on my cheeks, reducing inflammation and dryness.		I don't have severe acne and suspect that this product would not be strong enough for someone who suffers from more serious outbreaks.  My problem is that my skin scars easily from the acne that I do get and I tend to suffer from uneven skin tone.  For those problems, I feel this product has worked at least as well as I had hoped, definitely superior to other products I have tried.

I believe Nature's Gate Acne Treatment System is modeled after ProActiv, which provides a systematic approach to treating acne (i.e. cleanse, tone, and heal).  The active ingredient is ""Salicylic Acid"", which is a effective alternative to Benzoyl Peroxide, which can be quite drying for some individuals.  I use this product regularly and have reaped the benefits.  Your mileage may vary depending on your skin type and the severity of your acne.		That said, a recent problem I have encountered with kits purchased on Amazon, and one which every customer should be aware of, is the expiration date marked on the bottom of the box and on the products themselves.  On two occasions, I received kits that have expiration dates that have already past (some as  much as 10 MONTHS!!!!).  I believe this is TOTALLY  UNACCEPTABLE!!!  The product's effectiveness (or lack thereof) may be dependent upon whether or not the product is fresh.		BUYERS BEWARE!!!

Though sal. acid is effective for me to a certain extent, the peeling can become serious for me in a product like Clinique's.  Fortunately, I haven't had to deal with any peeling in this product.  Perhaps it's the combination of their ingredients or the strength of the salicylic acid.	 - I don't have to worry about ruined clothing or towels like I do when I use Proactive.	 - no current outbreak while using this product - I will update my review if this changes.  Usually I can't go a week without something flaring up - so far though, no problems.

B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,3.0,0,0,1021,"About the Ingredients","If natural ingredients are important to you, for whatever reason, and/or you have skin allergies to some ingredients, this acne treatment system may be for you. It is a set of 3 bottled acne products which are used together as a 3-step facial routine:  ""Corrective Cleanser"" (step 1),  ""Calming Toner"" (step 2), and ""Controlling Lotion"" (step 3).  A sticker on the box said ""Get CLEAR skin in 6 Weeks"" and ""Clinically Proven Effective Formula"".		The price is reasonable, especially when compared to competing systems of acne treatment.  It's something you can try for yourself without a huge price or a subscription hassle.		What sets this acne treatment apart from the others is that it does NOT have some common but irritating ingredients that are used in many (most?) of the others.		I have uploaded images of the ingredient lists from the box.  They are not easy to read; but the box isn't easy to read either, due to tiny font used on the ingredient lists. (To see the images, look underneath the main photo of the product, click on the ""see all x  customer images"" link)		This does not contain parabens.  Parabens are very common; they show up in almost all skin lotions and creams, and in other acne treatment ""systems"".  Parabens trigger rashes for many people with sensitive skin, including me.		I do not see benzyl (or benzyol) peroxide on the ingredient list either.  Benzyl peroxide is another potential irritant found in some competing acne products, and has the additional hassle of stained towels, etc., requiring extra care.		This set does not contain PAPBA (nor any other sunscreen), which is not surprising.  The directions recommend, if you are using their acne treatment system, that you ""avoid unnecessary sun exposure"" and put on some type of sunscreen before you go outside.  I'm guessing the product causes sun-sensitivity, at least temporarily.		The only ""active"" ingredient listed on the box is salicylic acid 1%, which is a lower percentage compared to some acne treatments; on the other hand that means it is less irritating, which I appreciate.  The salicylic acid 1% is in the step 1 cleanser, and in the step 3 lotion.		Tea tree oil (Melaleuca Altemifolia) is listed as an ingredient for each of the 3 bottles.  I consider tea tree oil to be an ""active""  ingredient when used in skin or hair (scalp) products, although the FDA may not yet recognize it as such (maybe FDA does not permit it to be listed as an ""active"" ingredient?).  The paper enclosed in the box (the Nature's Gate Organics Natural Results Acne Treatment System box) says that ""encapsulated Tea Tree Leaf Oil is particularly beneficial to acne-prone skin and helps reduce redness"".  On the other hand, I've heard that some people have a sensitivity to tea tree oil.		By the way, ""tea tree oil"" does not seem like a true ""oil"" to me; it does not make skin oily; I don't know how tee tree oil got its folk name; it seems a misnomer.  Some herbal ""experts"" claim that tea tree oil has some mild (or weak) anti-microbial properties when used on the skin.  I was already inclined to believe some of the claims for tea tree oil, since I've been using a foot spray with tea tree oil for the past 1-2 years.		Another unusual feature of this acne treatment system is that it contains extracts from about 12-20 different plants, and most or all of them are footnoted as ""certified organic"".		On the box, Nature's Gate describes ""Oligopeptide-10"" their patented combination of ""15 naturally occurring amino acids"".  Oligopeptide-10 is included in the step 2 ""Calming Toner"" bottle, and the step 3 ""Controlling Lotion"" bottle.  The box says ""Oligopeptide-10 and Salicylic Acid help neutralize pro-inflammatory bacteria ..."" ; that sounds good to me, but I don't have the scientific background to evaluate the claim.		This acne treatment system has a subtle scent that smells vaguely like green plants; it is not a strong scent.  If does not smell flowery or perfume-ish; and the scent is neither feminine nor masculine; just a slight scent of neutral botanicals.		Cons:  I wish the ingredients were listed in a larger font.  Trying to read them is giving me a headache.  It may sound trivial to others, but for someone like me, with so many skin allergies and sensitivities, those ingredient lists are so important.  However, this seems to be a problem with about 95% of the products in any grocery store, drugstore, and with 95% of all cosmetics and other toiletries; the readability problem is not limited to just this brand, and this font size may be a little larger than typical.		The painfully small font size gives the impression that companies don't want us to fully examine the ingredients list.  A company like Nature's Gate, with their fine product line, which has far better ingredients than average (at least from my allergy-prone viewpoint), seems likely to profit if they were to target the customer market segments consisting of people who consider the ingredients important.		I have 2 types of skin problems: (1) stubborn acne, and (2) skin allergies or sensitivities to ingredients often found in skin care products.  I've had allergic reactions (hives) and/or sensitivities (rashes) to many lotions, creams, sunscreens, and acne treatments, and also some make-up, scented laundry detergent, Dawn blue liquid dishwashing detergent.  I have not yet figured out all the ingredients that make my skin react.  Thus, trying a new product is an adventure.  I was glad to see that the specific chemicals that I know are definitely a problem for me (and probably many other people) are not contained in this product - no parabens, no PABA.		When I first tried this acne treatment system, my skin immediately looked so much smoother.  I was surprised at the quick improvement.  Unfortunately, several hours later I had a delayed reaction, and got a rash and itchy hives.		Even though I will not be able to continue use of this product, I still think it would be a good treatment system for many other people.  My husband will be trying it next."

It's localized on my chin, but it's enough to cause me some distress. I've tried several products to control it--some work, and some don't.		Basically, there are two major treatments for acne: ones that have salycic acid, and ones that contain benzoil peroxide. I find that benzoil peroxide (which is the ingredient in ProActiv) products usually work better for me. Nature's Gate, however, is a salycic acid acne treatment.		The kit comes with three different components: a corrective cleanser, a toner, and a controlling lotion. The product itself doesn't smell too nice. It smells very earthy--like lemon, mint and mud. (If you want a salycic acid product that works well AND smells good, I recommend Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash, a lovely-smelling facial scrub) When you use the toner, you'll probably want to use a cotton ball, as the consistency is very thin. The first time I used the controlling lotion, I was worried. Every time I have an acne breakout, my skin feels warm & oily. Well, the controlling cleanser MADE my skin feel warm and oily. I thought the heat it generated would be the cause of a breakout, but that wasn't the case. Be prepared for a bit of a burn (and maybe some dry skin) the first time you use it.		I've been using this for over a week now, and I haven't had any new blemishes. I've even used different brands of makeup (which has a tendency to break me out), but this has kept my acne in check. The product suggests that you'll be completely acne-free in 6 weeks, and so far... I have no reason to doubt their claim! I recommend it, even if it isn't the nicest-smelling product on the market."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,5.0,0,1,395,"A pleasant treatment... updated with results","Update: I've been using this for several weeks, and I'm a little disappointed.  The results were about average--there was no improvement, but no breakouts or rash, either.		I did run into a problem when I had to travel, though.  Two of the three products in this box come in 4 ounce containers.  With the security regulations currently in place, I couldn't bring them on the plane.  So much for my resolution to use this regularly!		* * * * *		I haven't been a teenager for some time, but all I need is one really stressful event to trigger the dreaded mid-nose zit that's waiting for the best opportunity to embarrass me.  On the bright side, people think I'm younger than I am.  On the other hand, IT LOOKS HORRIBLE!		I use a cleanser with salicylic acid at night, but use regular soap in the morning.  I could see as I read the directions for this system that I'll be doubling my use of salicylic acid, since you're supposed to use this product in the morning and at night.  That might make the difference.  Perhaps the ""oligopeptide-10"" (whatever that might be) will help, or the tea tree oil.		The box promises clear skin in six weeks.  I'll check back in then, but right now I'll post my initial impressions.		The packaging is nice and tasteful.  As an adult I'd be happy to receive this as a gift, if it was given privately.  A teenager would probably be mortified to find this (or any other acne treatment) under the Christmas tree.		Because I'm sensitive to perfumes, I was a little concerned about the fragrances in these products.  As soon as I opened them I knew it wouldn't be a problem.  Each of the three treatments has a different scent, but it's pleasant, very faint, not at all fruity or sweet or gender-specific, and triggered no reaction.		The cleanser and the lotion both feel smooth and rich, and all three products feel and smell like they're made with high quality ingredients.  Only a small amount of each was required.  They did not seem harsh and left my skin feeling clean.		Even if they don't completely control the stress breakouts I deal with occasionally, I'll probably keep using this product, just for the smell and the luxurious feel.  I'll update my review in a few weeks with results."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,5.0,0,1,331,"Better than Proactive!!","First, I'd like to say that everyone's skin is different and so sometimes the only way to know how products like this will work on YOUR particular skin is to try it.		I'm Asian and 30 years old.  I've struggled with acne here and there and have been on the Proactive system for over a year with mixed results.  My skin is better on Proactive, but not the best...I was not really happy with it and still broke out.  Proactive was also extremely expensive - $50.00 for the 3-piece system (they charge like 14.99 for shipping).		I tried out this Nature's Gate system with a lot of skepticism and I was definitely surprised.  From the 1st time I used it, I felt that it was doing something.  It tightened my skin and I could almost feel my pores shrinking.  I'm Asian and my skin is naturally oily, so maybe that's why I haven't experienced the drying like other reviewers have.  Also, I use a very small amount.  Just a dime size amount is enough to do the job.  If my face is extremely dirty or has a lot of makeup, I'll use another soap to remove all that excess first, then use this afterwards, so it's working on a ""clean slate"".  Normally though I just go straight for this morning and night.		I've been using it for 2 weeks now and am extremely pleased with it.  My acne has just about disappeared and my pores have definitely shrunk, I'm looking forward to seeing how my skin will be in a couple months of this treatment.  There is a pleasant smell to it, to me, it smells a little medicine-y, but not bad at all.  I can't believe how much better this worked for me and yet is still so much cheaper than the proactive.  I've cancelled proactive and am going to sign up for the automatic delivery here on Amazon.  That brings the price down to about $20.00.	Definitely worth it!"
B000FBNV1Y,2008,10,5.0,0,1,221,"Works well and smells good too!","We use a lot of Nature's Gate products and have for years so when I saw they had an acne treatment system I was really looking forward to trying it.		Two of my sons have had some acne problems for the past few years and I still get the occasional pimple myself so we were all looking forward to trying this out.		The kit comes with three products, a corrective cleanser, a calming toner and a controlling lotion.		The cleanser contains both Salicylic Acid (a commonly used acne treatment) and Tea Tree Oil. Both are good for clearing your acne, and they contain certified organic botanicals.		The calming toner, as well as some of the other products, have a new product called Oligopeptide-10.  Nature's Gate is the first company to include it. It's a fusion of 15 naturally occurring amino acids combine with Salicylic Acid.  It's works synergistically to eliminate bacteria and fight your acne.		The kit comes with a 4oz bottle of the corrective cleanser, a 4 oz bottle of the calming toner and a 2oz bottle of the controlling lotion.		One thing I really liked was how nice it smelled. Each products had a different but pleasant smell.		It works, we're seeing an improvement in our skin already.  I'd recommend this, it's natural and the price is right too."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,3.0,1,3,286,"Nature's Gate Acne Treatment System","I'm middle-aged and have never had serious acne, but I've had mild acne since I was a teenager.  I have been using salicylic acid (BHA) products and benzoyl peroxide with good results.		I'm rating this system as OK, pinging it one star because of the fragrance and one because of the toner.  All of the products contain plant and essential oils that can be fragrant, and fragrance is added to each.  The toner leaves my eyes watering for a while.		The cleanser works very well, and will even remove makeup, but you'll have to use eye makeup remover.  Be careful not to get this in your eyes.  I did, accidentally, and it really burned.  But I like the cleanser.  It works.		The toner is downright harsh.  I don't know why it makes my eyes water, but it does.  A menthol or camphor smell seems to waft from it, but they aren't listed in the ingredients.  It also leaves my skin feeling stripped.		The lotion is anything but greasy.  My skin feels smooth and soft, and clean.  It would be terrific if the lotion was two products - one as is, and the other with sunscreen.  You absolutely must use a sunscreen during the day.		The system is keeping my blackheads and pimples under control, and even though I have complaints about it, I do think it's worth trying because it's the best system I've used.  My personal regime has been cobbled together from different brands.  Every other acne system (products sold together) I've tried has been horrible.  This is definitely a step up.  And the packaging is very good, airtight and opaque.		I hope they make another version, with the 1% BHA, and a bit gentler."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,10,4.0,1,3,82,"Seems to work good so far","This is good it's all natural. It's nice to have all natural ingrediants for better, clearer skin. The system is easy to use and it doesn't sting like some products that have too much drying alcohol it it. The skin is not tight or dry. The really rough part of the month hasn't hit yet, so it hasn't been put to the real test yet-anxious to see how it fares on that stretch of the road. But so far I'd recommed it."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,4.0,0,0,67,"Smells good, seems to work","This acne product has a pleasant scent and seems to work well on skin that has a problem with pimples. I like that it is not harsh like some acne medications are, and that it is ""organic."" It doesn't leave a residue on my skin. I haven't used it long enough to know if it works well long-term, but so far so good. I'll keep using it."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,3.0,0,0,414,"Not much different than the other acne treatment systems out there","Nature's Gate Organics has a good product.  This 3-part system is designed to fight acne like most acne systems do.  1) there is a face wash (1% salicylic acid which is less than other brands), 2) there is a skin toner (Oligopeptide-10), and 3) there is a lotion (1% salicylic acid).		The differences between this and say Proactive, Oil of Olay, Clean and Clear, etc, is that this system is 1) Organic and 2) has tea essence.  What does that mean?  To me not a whole lot other than it has natural additives and it smells nice.		Bottom line is: does it work to clear acne?  Well, yes and no.  If you are looking for an instant solution, this is not it.  The box says it takes at least 6 weeks of treatment to see improvement.  Does it work on surprise breakouts?  Well, lucky me, I had rash of acne on my right temple when I got the box.  I've been using it for 3 weeks, and I do see improvement, but the acne is still there.  I guess I'll have to see at 6 weeks.  So, no this product does not work as a quick fix.		Additional goodness of this product is that it's less harsh than other systems I've used.  Know that the only active ingredient in this whole kit that fights acne is the salicylic acid.  This is the kicker for most treatment systems--some have more, some have less, but they all have it.  Why?  Because it kills bacteria and it helps to slough off dead skin, the two things that cause acne.  Back to the point, this is a less harsh system than others I've listed.  Due to that, I'm able to wash my face twice daily (as suggested by the instructions) and my skin is never dried out.  If I did this with my Oil of Olay scrub or my Oxyclean facewash, my face would be flaking all over.		So does this system work to clear acne? Yes.  Is it organic? Yes.  Does it smell nice? Only if you like tea.  Does it work fast? Only if 6 weeks is fast.  Does your skin get irritated? Not if you use it according to directions.  If all of these answers are what you are looking for in a acne treatment system, then this is one of many for you.  I give it three stars because it works, but does not stand out above any of the others--ie it is average."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,4.0,0,0,467,"Good product, but not as good as more popular brand names","I had never used a Nature's Gate product before. I have used Neutrogena's Complete Acne System--it worked for me. So I decided to try this system, too.		The kit comes with a 4 oz cleanser, 4 oz toner and 2 oz lotion. This is comparable to other systems, but the Nature's Gate products actually LAST long -- and they smell great. You only have to use a little bit of product and each bottle goes a long way.		DAY-BY-DAY RESULTS:		DAY 1 -- I don't have much acne -- a few small pimples on my forehead and cheek. I use the system twice a day -- the cleanser and toner feel great on the face and do not burn at all. The toner is the best part of the system -- it removes a lot of dirt/oil.		DAY 2 -- I use the product twice daily, again. This time, my face is irritated by the lotion, which is a bit strong. My face is not dry from the day before.		DAY 3 -- My skin is a little sensitive in the morning because of the lotion.		DAY 4 -- My skin feels softer and the acne is beginning to be less noticeable. Less redness on my face.		DAY 5 -- Blemishes are starting to go away, but  I notice two very small pimples forming on my cheek -- I  make sure to use the toner and lotion in the afternoon as well as in the morning in evening to stop the pimples from emerging.		DAY 6 -- I continue the treatment; not much change noticed from the day before.		DAY 7 -- No new pimples have formed, which is good.  The two pimples that were forming on Day 5 are gone, thanks to spot treatment (using the toner/lotion).		FINAL IMPRESSION:	Overall, I think this is a good system for light acne. I don't think it works as well as Neutrogena or the other popular brands, but this is organic and has a great smell. I would buy this product again because it's natural and smells much better than regular acne products, but if I had more serious acne I'd probably get a more effective/proven brand.		WHAT I DO LIKE:	The toner -- you can feel it working and it cleans the face well.		WHAT I DON'T LIKE:	The cleanser -- the cleanser doesn't have a thick enough consistency to really scrub deep within your pores, in my opinion. It kind of hovers on the surface of your skin, whereas with other products you kind of feel the cleanser/scrub get deeper down.		SOME TIPS ON USING THIS:	-Be really careful when applying the lotion around your eyes -- the lotion is strong and my eyes kind of start to sting when I put it on around my cheekbone/nose."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,3.0,0,0,273,"A mixed result...","I picked this product up a few weeks ago for two of my teens to try out.  Neither of them has a bad case of acne, but they do have mild cases of acne going (resulting mostly from stage make-up they used during a recent HS play they were in).		First, success:		My daughter (just turned 18) has been using this treatment for about 2 weeks now.  She reported that it did a good job of clearing up the acne on her forehead.  She did not report any excessively dry or peeling skin, and she is continuing to use it.		Second - well, less than success:		My son (16 yrs old) has some acne mostly on his cheeks, and he also started using this product a couple of weeks ago.  He reported that early on it looked like it was helping, but in less than a week he was suffering extremely dry and flaking skin, even after cutting the recommended number of treatments per day in half (as directed if excessive dry skin resulted).  He therefore stopped using it all together in just over a week.		So, what's my overall conclusion?		This product MAY do an excellent job of clearing up your acne, but the only way to tell is to get the product and try it out.		My guess is that if you have skin that is already fairly dry that you may experience the same result as my son, but it you have skin that is more moist or somewhat oily, this may be a great product for you.		Well, there you have it!  I hope this was helpful.		Good luck!"
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,4.0,0,0,175,"It works, but with some drying . . .","I'm prone to dry skin, so one of the major qualities I look for in acne medication is a preparation which doesn't dry my skin out any more than it does by itself.		A week after using this product, I noticed a big difference in the clarity of my skin.  Nature's Gate actually works a lot better than many better-known and more expensive acne treatment systems.  Unfortunately, it does tend to dry out my skin to an uncomfortable extent, so it's caused me to use it with some very careful application of moisturizer.  This can make the balance between dry skin and blemishes tough to manage perfectly, but I've managed to do so.		I can recommend this product with the caveats that it doesn't take very much to take care of minor skin problems - don't overuse it, or you'll just dry out your skin and cause secondary problems.  I'm also not clear on the ""organic"" aspect of this product . . . that seems to be pushing things a bit far with little explanation."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,5.0,0,0,239,"Works well for an ""organic"" product","Having tried everything from oxy pads to accutane to try and cure acne over the years, I realized I had never tried anything with ""natural"" ingredients. It would seem that the salyctic acid is the primary active ingredient with this product, but there is actually more to it than that.		For me, this system worked well for most all types of mild acne on my body, and at least as well or better than some of the more common brands available in stores. Of course, if you have very severe or cystic acne, this product (as well as pretty much any over the counter remedy or medication) is not going to be strong enough to fight the problem and actually could make it worse. If you have bad cystic acne, do whatever it takes to see a dermatologist and get it fixed before it gets out of control which can lead to permanent scarring.		I don't have a lot to add from what many of the other reviewers have said. The Nature's Gate system works well and does what it advertises when used properly. It may not work on everyone, but then again there is no drug or medicine that is 100% effective on everyone. I recommend this product, it is pleasant to use and it works well to clear and keep your skin free from everyday general acne problems. I definitely have noticed an improvement since using it."

In this case..  both the wash and the Step 3 cream contain this. Yes it works to some degree, because Salicylic acid in general works. I have yet to figure out what ""toner"" is or what it does. But it has a nice right to it doesnt it?		The makers of this seem to be capitalizing on the ""organic"" craze. If you are the tree hugger type and want your Salicylic acid to be organic instead of non organic then this might be right up your ally. If you dont care about the source of the active ingredient in  your acne medicine then safe a few bucks and buy the pharmacy brand of zit zapper."

The lotion is quick drying so I can add my make-up with in seconds of applying the lotion. I noticed some improvement with decrease in whiteheads but it did nothing for my blackheads.

This is not an all-natural organic product.  I as a little disappointed to find that out.  That being said, I have found it to be surprisingly effective, and not as harsh as some other products.		For a while I successfully used ProActive to treat my adult acne.  ProActive worked very well for me until I became sensitive to it.  I don't know if they changed their formula or if I just developed an allergy to one of the ingredients.  After that, even years later, I couldn't use the product without getting a painful rash.		I was very concerned that I would have a similar reaction to this product, especially after I read the ingredients.  Much to my surprise, I have not had any such reaction.  After using the cleanser my skin feels soft and smooth.  The results aren't as dramatic as the ProActive was before I became sensitive to it, but they are still pretty good.  My acne is very challenging and this has definitely improved it a lot.  With continued use I think this should take care of it altogether.		It is also an excellent value.  This kit is at least a full month's treatment, for about half the cost of ProActive or Murad.  I actually think there is enough here for six weeks of regular use, if you are conservative.		I would recommend anyone with sensitive skin who has had problems with the harsher treatments to give this a try."

Granted the instructions say to give it 6 weeks, my prescription acne medication (benzoyl peroxide) works within 1-2 days and I can't wait 6 weeks for my face to clear up. Overall, the Nature's Gate kit was not effective. There are 3 components to this system. Step 1 involves the use of a foaming face wash containing tea tree oil and salicylic acid, not unlike the St Ives face wash I buy at the local store. Step 2 requires the use of a calming toner that contains Oligopeptide-10, tea tree oil, sage, and alpha hydroxyl acids derived from lemon, apple, and orange extracts. The last stage, Step 3, requires the use of a controlling lotion that contains Oligopeptide-10 and salicylic acid. The instructions warn about your face getting too dry, but I found the lotion to be too greasy. I did like the toner and wash since it is similar to what I normally use but it just wasn't terribly effective as a replacement for prescription medication. However, every person is different so there are those with skin pH's and textures that may benefit from this system."

We had been considering something harsher like accutane -- which is what I used when I was fourteen and pimply, but that was extremely embarrassing for a a few months since it made me break out even worse before it got better.  As long as this seems to work, she and I are happy to stick with it.		What's more, she enjoys the smell and the feel of Nature's Gate on her face when she is done applying it -- what I think she is detecting is the tea tree oil, which has a very distinctive minty smell and tingle.  I was pleased to notice that the product is paraben free, as my other daughter is allergic to parabens.  This product uses organic and natural but apparently effective ingredients, and I would definitely buy it again -- I know my daughter plans to keep using it.  There are three different applications, and the instructions are very clear about how to use them."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,3.0,0,0,333,"Organic Acne Treatment?  Yes, but not quite as effective as conventional systems","I've been dealing with acne for some time, trying a variety of creams, astringents, masques, face washes, etc. I've used proactiv and Acne Free systems for several months now. I usually prefer acne treatment products that don't contain Salicylic acid, instead getting better results with benzoyl peroxide products. Both have their drawbacks and you should try both to see which works better for you then others.		I'm going to focus on the second step as representative of the system in general. While these systems are designed to be all in one, which seems convenient initially, what happens to me anyway, is that the three products run out at different times. You can find some kind of balance by buying new kits or if the manufacturer is kind, separately, but it is still annoying to run out of a step  out of sync before the others. Typically I run out the second step in these kits, usually a kind of astringent to remove dead skin cells and other contaminants. This has been my experience so far using Nature's Gate.	It also has a fairly strong smell, that smell odorous at first, but eventually something to get used to. Each container contains a flip top, similar to what you might find on some brands of hair products. It works fine with step 1 and 3 liquids, but works poorly in step two. Perhaps mine is defective, but it leaks a small amount of liquid after dispensing. The only solution is to unscrew the entire cap and carefully dab some on a cotton pad.		Also be careful not to use too much of step one, it is highly concentrated, so only a few drops will clean your face well. Too much and it will be difficult rinse off entirely.		Overall I think Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment system has been useful, but will go back to using Acne Free Products. The Salicylic Acid and other ingredients doesn't keep my skin as clear as Benzoyl peroxide products."

I can definitely see improvement in my skin!  I have less acne and a few old red marks cleared up. I think the lotion is one of the mildest I have used and makes my skin very soft.  The only other negative I would have is the smell, it's not very pleasant but if this means no fragrances were added then I am pleased (I did not verify this).

Looking at the package and ingredients, the treatment comes with a corrective cleanser, calming toner, and controlling lotion.  Each separate step of the cleaning process is easy to do.  The acne treatment corrective cleanser contains Salicylic Acid and tea tree oil that exfoliates and opens pores.  Step 2, the toner, gets rid of pore impurities, ie the 'bad' stuff, and soothes any skin irritation.  The third step is used to prohibit further acne growth.		A disbeliever of most acne products, Nature's Gate has made me a believer.  Not only is my skin clearer, but those unsightly blackheads that plague my cheeks and nose are less noticable.

I've been using it for about a week already (the package said allow 4-6 weeks for the full effect) and i have to say, it seems to have actually started to work.  The three-step system is pretty easy to do, and not really time consuming (it's easy to work into your morning/nite routine).  Step 1's face wash (using the special foaming lotion-like stuff) made my face feel pretty clean.  Step 2's toner solution (which is sorta like Sea Breeze, only not nearly as astringent - your face won't feel a sensation) preps you for step 3's thin coat of lotion.  I liked the smell of the lotion, as it's pleasant without being emasculating.  I sometimes get skin irritation from shaving and breakouts, and it seems like my face has been a bit more clear in the week or so since i've been using the product, so at this point, i'd have to say i plan on continuing using it, as it seems to be getting results.  The kit comes with enough of all three steps' materials, that i'd have to think at the rate you'll use them, that it might last around 2 months at least per kit (it doesn't take a whole lot of the solutions/lotions to do the daily steps)."

The product was just TOO harsh and left her with a rash on her face and throat. Therefore she had to discontinue use before she really got to see any sort of tangible results.		It could be that this product is simply highly allergenic to some, irritating to others and then may be the perfect product for those with less sensitive skin. However, my daughter has never had a reaction like this before to numerous products (some containing very similar ingredients) so I would not classify her as someone with highly reactive skin.		All this said, I rated this item a 3* because it would seem to have effective ingredients and I am always in favor of organic alternatives. I assume that it is effective for some based on what I have read. My advice would be to consider it with caution. It may be just the thing for YOU, but beware that it appears to also be just the thing others have had POOR reactions to."

We've tried every over-the-counter treatment, as well as Proactive, and experienced very few positive results despite all the claims and promises of effectiveness.  Proactive worked best, but he still had significant flare ups.  His acne is very persistent and limited to one region (forehead).  He has been using Nature's Gate for a few weeks now.  I would say it is slightly better than everything we have tried so far.  We've noticed a reduction in his acne and his complexion has also cleared slightly.  The larger acne is still somewhat prominent, although there are fewer bumps.  The smaller bumps have all but disappeared, leaving nothing but small scars to remind they were there.  I'm hopeful, over time, the larger bumps will continue to diminish and eventually disappear as well.  Overall, it's a slight improvement over the other acne products we've tried and the biggest benefit is that it's organic and doesn't contain the harsh chemicals that sometimes irritated his skin and led to over drying.  Despite the three step process, he seems committed to the twice a day regimen.  He is pleased with the results and happy to finally see any positive response to treatment.  I plan to have him continue using  Nature's Gate and feel it is worth a try for people with sensitive skin, allergies, or who have experienced poor results with other products.  I'm starting to believe there is no single magic bullet for everyone, however, different products seem to work better or worse on different people.  My daughter responded much better to Proactiv and she wasn't nearly as committed in usage as he was.  The only reason I gave Nature's Gate three stars is because, to me, four stars indicates very significant acne reduction and five would be the complete elimination of acne.  So far, I would classify my son's acne reduction as moderate.  If continued usage eventually results in the elimination of more of the larger bumps, I will happily raise my rating."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,4.0,0,0,334,"I Like It!","I used Nature's Gate's acne treatment system for about two weeks, and I am impressed with the results. My skin has given me trouble since age 10, and while I can't say I have raging acne, I have had problems with consistent breakouts in spite of trying a broad range of products. This three step system seems to be one of the best because it includes lotion to re-moisturize the skin to replace any essential oils that have been stripped while cleansing.		I used the lotion only once a day (at night) as the box suggested, during the day using another brand's moisturizer, and still saw results. After about a week of use, any pimples I had went away and my skin felt smooth for the first time in years. There weren't even imbedded bumps on my forehead. The only thing it didn't get rid of were the deep blackheads on my nose which never seem to sprout into anything anyway. In the second week, the skin around my chin started to feel a bit dry, so I used more lotion on that area and it seemed to work fine. Suddenly one day, my forehead started to break out, and I figured my skin had gotten used to the formula already and was retaliating. But after two more days, everything that had come up was gone.		This product is not entirely organic and uses a few ingredients that some warn to stay away from. For example, the last ingredient is ""fragrance"" which can irritate the skin and serves no cleansing purpose. That being said, none of these items smell very good. At best, they smell like ingredients from the spice rack (and with good reason-- they include things like rosemary and sage).		I am not sure if this is an effective year round treatment (I normally have to use a stronger product in the summer since I sweat more and the air is more humid) but it is certainly effective for the winter months."

The toner and lotion helped to ""decrease the amount of drying""  However, overall, the product did not seem to ""work as fast"" as the benzol peroxide based products.

It's pleasant to use -- not harsh in the least. There are certainly cheaper products on the market that use the same active ingredient, but this is the only one I know of that focuses on natural components.		The kicker is that at the end of the day, the active ingredient is salicylic acid. For some people, it can help in controlling acne. For others, it's completely ineffective. It really depends on the user.		It should be noted that this product is for acne control, not prevention. The item text claims that it can help prevent acne, but I believe that phrase is misleading. Acne is mainly a hormonal issue."

This product is nice in that it is not harsh on the skin.  I have used this product for about a month, and my skin did not flake or get red because of it. I do have sensitive skin and usually start having problems w/ the dryness.	However, I don't think the 1% salicylic acid is enough for me because I still got a few new zits.  Personally I need a product in addition to the cleanser, calming toner and controlling lotion, I need an exfoliator.  This is easily done w/ simple baking soda or granulated sugar, if I can remember to bring it into the shower with me.  I would mix it with the cleanser, and it would probably be helpful.	So if you are looking for an organic, gentle solution to your not seriously severe acne, I would say give this system a try.  It is relatively inexpensive.

I've been using Nature's Gate for a few weeks now and have noticed some improvement on my face, not that it was really bad to begin with.  Perhaps it's too early to tell.		Regardless, after following the 3-step process I can say that my face feels incredibly clean and rejuvenated.  It feels awesome!  I suppose that's the whole purpose of this system, right? -- to make the face feel renewed.  It's worth noting too that the substances in each of the bottles smell very good!  I was pleasantly surprised at the scent of each of these substances -- they each have a pleasant almost citrus-like scent.		I stopped using ProActiv a while back because I just wasn't getting the results anymore.  So far this one has nicely taken it's place.  Give it a try."

B000FBNV1Y,2006,7,5.0,20,24,361,"Works as well as benzoyl peroxide products without the ruined towels!","I have been using Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System for just under a year now and absolutely love the results.  I had been using another kit that uses benzoyl peroxide as its main acne-fighting ingredient, but it really dried my skin out and the bleaching action of the peroxide ruined countless towels and T-shirt necklines.		So when a friend recommended Nature's Gate Organics Acne Kit, I thought I'd give it a try.  After that first kit, I've never even considered using anything else.  I find the salicylic acid based formula gentler on my skin but still very effective at clearing up breakouts and preventing new ones.  I've used salicylic acid products in the past without the greatest results, but however Nature's Gate Organics acne product is formulated, IT WORKS.  (According to their packaging, it's the combination with the Oligopeptide-10 that makes the salicylic acid more effective.)		It's really important to stick to the complete regimen, though.  When I first started using the kit, I used the three products haphazardly, using the cleanser one day but not the toner and lotion, etc.  I could tell the difference, though, when I followed the package directions and used all three.  The cleanser, toner and lotion each have their function and I'm really happy with how my skin feels and looks when I use the whole system.  I've gotten a lot of compliments on how good my skin looks, too, since I started using Nature's Gate Organics.		This is also the first formula I've found that didn't dry out my skin.  I think most acne products are formulated for teens with really oily skin.  For those of us past puberty (I'm 30+) but still dealing with adult acne, we need products that are effective but gentle. And the fact that it contains natural/organic ingredients is an added bonus.  All of those botanicals makes it smell great, too!		For me, Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment is perfect.  I don't write a lot of reviews, but I felt compelled when I saw it posted here because I really believe in this product.  Plus, I'm so glad Amazon is offering it and at such a good price!"
B000FBNV1Y,2009,5,5.0,7,7,515,"Everyone has a different skin type, but worked for me!","I did a lot of research on organic, cruelty-free skincare before choosing this kit, and I've noticed pretty much everything has extreme ratings on all organic skincare products, either good or bad.  Everyone has a different lifestyle, genes, skin type, etc. that factor into their acne causes, but my review is based on the following:		-I've tried Proactiv, Clinique, Doxycycline and accompanying prescription treatment system, and all of them only made me worse and rashy/Doxy made me extremely sick.	-I have allergic skin reactions to many chemicals, like those found in standard laundry detergent.	-My acne is mostly hormonal - when I started taking birth control pills and using tea tree oil and some soap it completely cleared up.  I also break out a lot from stress.  I'm also a professional musician and spend a lot of time on stage in costume, with heavy makeup on, sweating up a storm, which helps me break out as well.	-I'm 25, female, vegetarian, consume very little refined sugar, dairy, wheat, processed foods, exercise daily and avoid OTC medication as much as possible (I DO consume alcohol regularly).		That being said, when I stopped taking birth control pills, my weight dropped dramatically, prompting me to not want to get back on them.  However, my acne, after five years of being clear, returned with a vengeance, and tea tree oil no longer cut it.  I had cystic acne up and down my entire back and neck, weird rashlike acne on my upper arms with huge weird bumps that would eventually pop like zits, and tons of breakouts on my face.  It this was worse than ANYTHING I've ever had, even as a teenager.		Within a couple days of using Nature's Gate, my regular acne had almost completely cleared up, and my cystic acne looked like regular acne.  I am, as well, supplementing with vitamins and a homeopathic acne pill (ClearAc), as I read acne can be caused by things like poor blood oxygenation, zinc deficiency or other vitamin-repairable factors.  Someone said they felt burning when they used this kit - I just feel a gentle, refreshing tingling.  As I said before, though, everyone has different sensitivities!		Keep in mind, you DO have to have a religious skin regimen to see results, as with anything, be it Nature's Gate, ProActiv, or just plain bathing.  You wouldn't expect your deodorant to keep you from stinking if you didn't reapply it or bathe for multiple days!  And, for some people, it may take longer than others to see said results.		Long story short, I don't usually write long reviews, but I feel very strongly about using cruelty-free, natural products whenever possible, and, as a professional musician, I was having a really hard time being broken out and performing every night, being photographed, filmed for television, etc., as so many people see me daily!  I hope some of you with similar lifestyles/body types read my review and find it helpful.  Btw, I did a little searching online and found this kit for only $17, which is initially why I decided to try it!"
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,3.0,6,6,243,"Can't see much of a difference","Even though I'm out of my teens, I still have problems with blemishes appearing so I'm willing to try anything to completely clear my skin. The Nature's Gate Organic Acne Treatment is a three step process of cleanser, toner and lotion. The box says for morning and night use and I've been using it everyday without a problem so it should be okay for twice a day, everyday use.		I've been doing the three step process everyday for almost two weeks and I can't really see a difference in my skin. It doesn't really take care of blackheads and it has not stopped a new zit from forming on my forehead. The three step process is a bit tedious and if you do not have the patience to perform the regime, it can probably be easy to stop because you just don't feel like keeping up the process.		On the plus side, it's great to find an organic product. Especially because it doesn't have any harsh or strong smells to it as some acne treatments can have. It also has cut down on my forehead getting too oily during the day which is a great thing.		So even though it hasn't really made too much on my skin yet, I'm planning to keep using the product in hope that it can change my skin some. And even though it hasn't totally worked with me, doesn't mean that it can't work for some people."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,10,4.0,5,5,532,"Here's the key:  MOISTURIZE, MOISTURIZE, MOISTURIZE","I received Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System to try out as part of the Vine program and have been pleased with its performance so far.  I must admit that I no longer have the huge acne problems that I used to have when I was a teen and in my early 20s.  Part of the reason why it seems to have resolved itself is that I learned how to better take care of my skin.  When I was in my 20s, I purchased the ProActiv acne treatment system and it really helped clear my skin.  The Nature's Gate system is of a similar vein -- it comes with a facial cleanser with salicyclic acid to clean your skin and pores of oil and acne-causing bacteria; toner to neutralize the PH of your skin following washing and further cleansing the pores; and acne treatment lotion with salicylic acid to reduce inflammation and keep your pores clear.		Contrary to its name, salicylic acid is actually a very effective acne inhibitor without being too harsh, though it is not as strong as benzoyl peroxide, which is not in the Nature's Gate system but can be found in the ProActiv system or otc acne medications such as Clearasil.  Thus, I think that the Nature's Gate Acne Treatment System might be a cheaper and also effective alternative to the higher-end ProActiv system, for those who have mild to moderate acne problems.		But here's the key to having either system work for you:  you have to find a good moisturizer!  So, indeed, the acne treatment cannot be effective only in 3 steps -- you need to have four steps!  Of course, both systems sell moisturizers separately, so that they can make more money off of you.  But you don't need to buy theirs.  In fact, I've found that every skin type can react very differently to different brands/types of moisturizer, so the tricky part is that you may have to experiment with a few, in order to find the right balance.  One moisturizer that I've found to be really effective for acne-prone skin, without greasiness, is Ahava moisturizers (which can be pricey, but most of their products are worth it) which can be found here on Amazon.		A word of warning, if you use no moisturizer, you may find that the Acne Treatment system actually WORSENS your acne as your skin may end up filling your pores with oil in order to compensate for the lost moisture that comes from cleansing the face.  In fact, you are better off (in my humble opinion) if you're pressed for time or lazy, skipping washing your face altogether, than washing it but skipping the other steps.  You should always tone and moisturize after washing your face.		The nice part about these acne treatment systems is that once you get your acne under control, you can buy less pricey products at the drug store and get the same results.  Now on a near-daily basis, I use a facial cleanser with salicylic acid (Phisoderm), a toner (Oil of Olay or Ahava), and a moisturizer (Ahava) which pretty much keeps my skin clear and I get a pimple maybe 2-3 times a year."

For me, this product was useless in clearing up acne.  I broke out the entire time I used it.  The cleanser & astringent aren't enough.  I used them up over a month ago & have maybe a 1/4 of the cream left.  The only good thing it seemed to do was help to exfoliate my skin keeping away the dry winter flakes that are included with my acne.  Crazy, but that's me.  Salicylic Acid isn't rated as being too safe if you are pregnate or want to have kids... hardly Organic!!  I didn't know this until after I was using it.  I will finish it up so it doesn't go to waste but will not purchase in the future."

(I will come back and update my review if this changes.)  The box comes with complete and clear instructions.  The packaging and labels on the bottles are neither feminine nor masculine.  It's pretty much ""acceptable"" for both guys and girls.  The products don't have a medicine smell or any kind of floral or girly smell.  The cleanser and toner are lightly scented, but it's nothing that lingers or bothers me.  I can be sensitive to perfume smells due to allergies, and this doesn't affect me at all.  The corrective cleanser and controling lotion bottles are labeled with expiration dates on the bottom.  If you are looking to try a skin care system that's as good as, if not better in my opinion, than the ""leading brands"" give this a try.

B000FBNV1Y,2009,0,5.0,3,3,498,"Gentle on the skin and effective.","As someone in their 40's who has suffered with acne for a good portion of their life, one learns to manage their expectations when it comes to acne products.  Nature's Gate acne product is not a cure all, but it does provide an effective regimen, which is similar to ProActiv, at a fraction of the cost.  While I don't believe any regimen out there is totally ""chemical free"", this one at least contains several natural ingredients, which aren't as harsh on your face as some of the other products I've tried.  I love the fact that it does not leave my face either dry or greasy feeling.  With average use, I believe the ""kit"" is meant to last for 3 months.		I used the product for 4 weeks, and the following are my conclusions.		  1. The Corrective Cleanser has a very light feel, similar to shampoo.  Initially I questioned whether it was really working, but it does.  After rinsing it off, my face actually felt clean.  The cleanser itself has a mild, non-lingering scent.  As part of my shower routine in the morning and the evening, I also use a mild exfoliating scrub by Crabtree & Evelyn called Naturals - Solutions for Men (Daily Face Scrub).  The combination works very well for me.	  2. The Calming Toner removes excess oils that could block the pores.  It works fairly well, has a decent scent, and did not dry out my skin, which many alcohol based toners tend to do.  I just wish they gave you a larger bottle.  The problem with many of these regimens is that they tend to have a ""one size fits all"" approach.  I really respect acne regimens like AcneFree, which give you so much more for your money.	  3. I really like the Corrective Lotion.  My first test for it was, ""does it leave my face either dry or greasy?""  To be fair, I must tell you, I have oily skin.  After a long stressful day, my face does not feel or look greasy.  The second test was, ""does the acne treating component work for me?""  Well, so far so good.  The lotion contains salicylic acid, which is a key ingredient in many skin-care products for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, and warts.  It works by causing the cells of the epidermis to shed more readily, preventing pores from clogging up, and allowing room for new cell growth.  I think it also assists in evening out your skin tone.		The long and short is that the product works pretty well for me so far.  Understand, though, that everyone's skin is different, and to effectively treat acne, you must find a combination that works for you.  That includes the right shampoo, conditioner, gel, face regimen, etc.  I wish I would have had that advice as a teenager.  I like the fact that this product is not harsh to my face and contains several natural ingredients.  For $25, it's worth a try."

In that vein, she had already made the decision to try a natural product when we got the opportunity to try this out.		There are a lot of good things about this product.  The smell is pleasant and mild, and the product spreads over the skin quite easily.  It doesn't feel harsh, nor does it leave your face feeling overdried.  One of the really great things about this product is that it does not contain benzoyl peroxide: she happens to be allergic!		In terms of how effective it is, we're still only about 10 days into it, but it looks to work decently well.  One thing to note (and this is true about any change in skin care) is that the transition was very hard.  Switching to a new skin regimen is tough on the skin to begin with, and because those previous medications were very harsh, it amplified the effect.  Plus, quite frankly, her acne was somewhat severe.		During the first week, in addition to a few big painful cystic acne blemishes that came to the surface, she developed these little tiny bumpy zits on the side of her face.  These were especially distressing to her.		A week into it, the tiny zits have, for the most part, gone away.  The cystic acne blemishes have retreated, for the most part.

I'm not an expert and I didn't research every little thing on the ingredient list, but there is some really good, natural stuff in here.  Two, my skin felt very clean after use.  The cleanser lathers really well, you hardly need more than a dime sized drop and the toner and moisturizer felt really refreshing as well.  Three, to me it smells really good.  I know a few people had complaints about the smell, but to me it was a natural, clean fragrance.  There isn't much I don't like about this product besides the fact that it just didn't clear up my skin.  Also, the moisturizer was a tad on the oily side...sometimes after applying it my face looked kind of shiny and felt a little greasy...maybe I was just using a little too much.  I also think the reason it didn't really work that well for me was because everything ran out at different times.  The toner was the first to go...I used that up within about 3 weeks or so.  Then the moisturizer and like I said, I've only got a bit of the cleanser left...which I am still using, because it does make my skin feel clean and fresh.

Within the first week of using this product my entire face broke out in a rash that looked like tiny little red dots all over my skin (similar looking to a heat rash). Additionally, my skin itched like crazy!		I was obviously having a negative reaction to some ingredient in the product - however, I was not sure which. I know I'm not allergic to salicylic acid because I have used products with it before and did not develop the same rash.		In an effort to find a potential cause, I contacted Nature's Gate asking if they had had any other customers write about experiencing the same reaction and/or what the possible cause might be (a company SHOULD know this before selling its product). Guess what they said............		That's right, NOTHING. I never heard back from the company, even after repeated attempts to get in contact with them. I didn't want to give up so easily on the product as I choose to support natural, non-animal tested brands - but their lack of care for their own customers and non-existent customer service coupled with the fact that their product provided me with a nice, itchy red rash, has motivated me to give this product and company a negative review. If I could give zero stars, I would. I have never had such a poor experience before with a skin care system or company. Buyer beware!"

It help to decrease some of the acne, but it didn't clear it up completely. So after doing some research I decided to purchase the benoxyl peroxide soap.  The benoxyl peroxide soap work great to clear up my skin.  It drys the skin out, so I decided to give the nature's gate acne treatment another try, since my acne wasn't as severe.  It same to keep things under control for about 2 weeks, then the acne slowly return.  I should mention that instead of using the toner I used apple cider vinegar, which has always worked great for me.  Instead of using the creme I used shea butter and coconut oil on my face, which keeps my face moisturized.		So this product didn't work great for me when I tried it the first time following the instructions, and it didn't work the second time even after I added other products that work.		If you want to see my full review visit my blog [...]		I will have to do some research to find a soap that is just as good as benoxyl peroixide soap that I'm using but is not as harsh to the skin.  The best and natural way to fight acne, is to go on a yeast restricted diet, after going on this diet for the first time, my skin was completely cleared within a month.  I used lemon to clear up the scaring.  I'm not able to keep up with the yeast restricted diet for very long because it causes you to loose weight and I'm already small.		Natural Joyanne"

B000FBNV1Y,2010,3,5.0,0,0,315,"Wonderful Kit","This is such a wonderful Acne Kit for me.  I have had some really wonderful results using these products.	Everyone will get different results, but for me to get the great results, I had to use the system twice a day everyday, and not forget to do it.  It took about 6 weeks before I starting to see the great results, so you may need to be patient.  This is not a cure, once you stop the system, just like any other acne treatment the acne will come back, or is you get lazy and miss a day or two, you might break out.  So remember that you have to keep on it.  That goes for any acne system I have used.  If you want results have have to be diligent.	I found this to be very gentle on my skin, and had a great smell, and no alchol.	Of course I do have a few things I don't like.  I would like to see bigger sizes of the toner and the moisterizer since I go through them so fast.  I would also like to see the salicylic acid be at 2%.	Other than that I am very happy with the products, and the moisterizer for me is amazing.  I don't seem to sweat it out of my pores like many times happens with other products that I used.  I also like that it contain many heaing herbs and amino acids.	As for the comment someone made that salicylic acid wasn't organic, I am not sure that is true.  I have always thought it was made from a compond in the willow tree, if I remember correctly. The same stuff asprin comes from.  Can anyone comment on that, that has any knowledge.  Anyways.  Best stuff I have found so far.	I only hope it will work for you as well as it has for me."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,4.0,1,2,838,"A pleasant facial cleanser and acne treatment","The Nature's Gate Organic's Treatment System is a straightforward salicylic acid preparation to treat acne with some added twists.		THE QUICK RUNDOWN:		PROS--	1. Pleasant to use	2. Contains salicylic acid and tea tree oil, two proven ingredients for treating acne in a mild base	4. Contains a proprietary ingredient--Oligopeptide-10--that may be beneficial	3. Worked well for mild acne	4. Organic botanicals		CONS--	1. Still drying--as with many acne products	2. Not all natural--some synthetic products	3. Sheer number of botanicals may make it less suitable for those with multiple allergies		THE LONG REVIEW--		THE CONTENTS OF THE KIT:	The kit comes with three components: a cleanser, a toner, and a lotion that are used serially.  The kit suggests using the components once daily at initiation and working up to twice daily usage once your skin acclimates to the product.		The cleanser is pleasant to use and lathers nicely when applied.  It contains a mild soap, salicylic acid, and botanicals which yields reasonable cleaning without overdrying.		The toner has a pleasant odor and also contains similar ingredients in a base that is not overly harsh and does not leave a residue or film on the face.  It is glycerol based NOT alcohol based and therefore more mild on the skin than alcohol based products.		The lotion is light and smooth.  It seems to be absorbed well by the skin and does not leave a visible shine.		THE INGREDIENTS:		SALICYLIC ACID--The product does not seem to over dry the skin as do many acne products.  On the other hand, salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide are the two major ingredients in over-the-counter acne medications.  1% salicylic acid is the lowest strength of the salicylic acid products and is probably the mildest treatment for acne out there.  On the other hand, more harsh treatments seem to exacerbate acne (at least in the short term) and can be painful for the user.		OLIGOPEPTIDE 10--Oligopeptide-10 is a proprietary compound used by this company and (apparently) cannot be listed as an 'active ingredient' per the FDA. I found a press release from the company.  It states that a panel compared a formulation containing Oligopeptide-10 with a standard preparation containing benzoyl peroxide.  The panel found that this compound was superior in reducing moderate acne lesions,  worked faster, and reduced irritation more than a 'leading' benzoyl peroxide based product.  It would be nice if the company could provide more details about their panel research. (This is always the problem when buying a new product.) Given that this product is more gentle on the skin than standard anti-acne products, it would be a great find if the panels experience pans out.		TEA TREE OIL--There is some evidence and certainly a lot of testimony on the web that tea tree oil is effective in treating acne.  A number of studies have shown that tea tree oil gel significantly reduces acne when compared to placebo. In one study was ""3.55 to 5.75 times"" more effective than placebo.  The contribution of the other added botanicals is less certain but may add to the effect of the other components.  (Warning--tea tree oil is often harsh on some peoples skin.  This is usually the case for me, but this product seems different.  It may have to do with a lower concentration of tea tree oil or a more protective base)		Given the presence of tea tree oil and salicylic acid, it would seem that this product has the potential to be beneficial in mild to moderate acne whether or not Oligopeptide-10 really ends up contributing to the product's efficacy.		BOTANICALS--this has many botanical extracts derived from organic sources that may enhance the products efficacy.  Those with many topical allergies, however, may have to steer clear as the sheer number of added botanicals may pose a higher risk of an allergic reaction.  I am fairly atopic and did just fine here, but with so many ingredients reactions are always a risk.		ORGANIC BUT NOT ALL NATURAL--All the botanicals contained herein are from organic certified sources, but some ingredients (e.g. polysorbate-80) are not necessarily natural.		SOMEWHAT DRYING--most acne remedies seem to work though astringent/antibacterial effects and through skin drying.  This product is no different.  For me it seemed less harsh than most over the counter remedies but everyone's skin is different and it may be too drying for you.  Remember, this is not an all-purpose product, it is an acne treatment product and is probably not good for folks with already dry skin or eczema.		CONCLUSION:	On the whole, this is a well put together and pleasant to use product. Its price is on par or less than other acne remedies and for me it worked well.		I will try to update the review after my teenage son (the real test case) uses this for a two to four week period.  The 'jury is still out' but so far it seems to be more mild than most over-the-counter products and over a four day period has been just as efficacious without the usual harshness."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,4.0,1,2,33,"Good value","This system is comparable to other 3-part products on the market, but at a much lower price point. I just began using and will update with results in a week or two. Thanks."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,10,2.0,1,2,143,"a disaster for my middle-age super oily skin","Well, I used the product with high hopes, following the steps as directed, and the first couple of times, my face felt pretty good. Steps one and two made my face feel ultra-clean--dry really--and the moisturizer made it feel good. Soon, however, my skin started to burn, itch and hurt and it had the texture of sandpaper. Ouch! Too bad it didn't work for me. I'll hand it down to my son, maybe he can get some use out of it. But I am skeptical, because I don't think he would have the patience and diligence to follow the steps and do the whole program, as it is meant to be used. If you are reading these reviews and considering buying this product, I am sure that you are motivated to give it a fair try. That's the only way you can know."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,10,4.0,1,2,247,"Pregnant? Be careful .. be aware ...","The product itself is really good. It works well on the skin, doesn't smell, and is boosted by its Oligopeptide booster to Salicylic acid. But if you are pregnant you should consider that S.Acid is an Aspirin derivative that you use topically. Aspirin is typically not OK to use if you are pregnant. There have been no studies to show if this is an issue topically. Most likely it isn't.		""Salicylic acid is used to treat acne, warts and other dermatological problems. There are no studies specifically looking at topical salicylic acid in pregnancy. Oral salicylic acid (aspirin) has not been associated with an increase in malformations if used during the first trimester, but use in late in pregnancy has been associated with bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding (Rumack et al., 1981). The risks of aspirin late in pregnancy are probably not relevant for a topical exposure to salicylic acid, even late in the pregnancy, because of its low systemic levels. Topical salicylic acid is common in many over-the-counter dermatological agents, and the lack of adverse reports suggests a low teratogenic potential.""		This came from fetal-exposure'dot'org / acne'dot'html		I personally don't think it will be an issue - but you have to balance out your own desire to handle acne (the mental stress) with the physical stress that you may be placing on a child.		Again - product is great, does what it needs to and does it with proven medicine. But be informed about S.Acid and pregnancy."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,10,4.0,1,2,303,"Clearer skin without over-drying","I thought that when I got older I wouldn't have to worry about pimples, but at 32 I still have to deal with a few pimples all of the time, and I break out more extensively once a month. I have combination skin, and most products that fight pimples dry out my skin, especially on my cheeks.		I've never tried any prescription cleansers or the popular mail order skin care brands like Proactive.		I have used many cleansers from the drugstore/health food store, and I have used Clinique's 3 step skin care. It seems like a new product will work well for a short time, and then stop being as effective, so I switch products.		I was interested in this product because it is vegan and has organic ingredients. I was also curious because this uses a different combination of acne fighters than any of the other products that I've seen.		Oligopeptide-10 is an organic, anti-microbial peptide created from plant derived amino acids. It is supposed to work well in combination with Salicylic acid, allowing you to get a better result from a lower concentration of salicylic acid.		This package contains a three step skin care system; a cleanser, a toner, and a moisturizer (it is called a ""controlling lotion"" and has salicylic acid in it). You are supposed to use all three products twice a day.  The products smell natural, without a harsh chemical smell.		I've been using the product for more than six weeks and I love how soft my skin feels. It doesn't make my skin dry, like all of the other products I've tried.		It's not perfect, though. During the worst of my monthly breakouts, I am switching between this and a Benzoyl Peroxide based cleanser. Salicylic acid doesn't seem to work for me when my hormones get wacky."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,10,5.0,1,2,186,"Now I am a believer!!!!!!!!!!","This is a three step cleaning system made of natural ingredients that are healthy for the skin.  Tea tree oil never smells that great to me, but I found the products to be inoffensive.	I love that the bottles are clearly numbered in the order that you use them.  The wash (bottle one) is mild, but left my skin very clean.  The toner (bottle two) felt a little sticky.  Like there was some residue but after using it several times I find it works wonderfully.  The third bottle has concentrated liquid to put on troubled spots.  A little goes a long way.	All in all, I am very pleased and like the idea of doing less chemical damage to my skin and still addressing the things I wanted to.  As always, I also moisturize.	********* UPDATE **********	It has been a couple of months.  I went to get a facial this past week and the woman who has been seeing me for years asked me what I had changed in my skin care.  I recommend this and will continue to buy this product.  What a difference."
B000FBNV1Y,2009,1,2.0,2,4,64,"I had something done that was worth every cent!","Anyone fighting acne like I have for the past 2 years, theres a procedure called Levulan. It's worth it. It's like a peel, but not as harsh or drastic. My skin has cleared 98% after 1 treatment. I only purchase organic/animal cruelty free products and while natures gate is a great product, I didn't really care for all the steps to cleaning my skin."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,4.0,2,4,182,"Natural is always the best, results are positive","Natural ingredients is always best for the skin. Chemicals may have side effects which we may not be aware of or which appear later on. As the cleansing process involves 3 different products, it will take a bit of time from your hectic schedule. Some may find it a chore. But for the sake of better looks, it's worth it. Like any facial treatment, the results vary with individual. However, the natural ingredients should be quite safe to try it out. Despite made in USA and natural ingredients, the price is reasonable.	Update	------	After 3 weeks of usage (I use it only at night as I found no obvious benefit applying it again just a few hours the following morning), I notice my skin becomes smoother and less new acne appear. Results are positive! It cannot stop acne altogether but is able to prevent them from growing to a stage where they can burst easily and cost scarring. As for blackheads, they will not be removed. Overall, I find it beneficial to continue using as long as acne is still around."

Unfortunately, I didn't get the results I was hoping for.		Honestly, I didn't see much change at all (except for a dried out face). Granted, I didn't use the product for the entire month--but I figure if I didn't see any noticeable results after two weeks, I probably wasn't going to see any after a month."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,4.0,1,1,106,"So far, so good!","It's been a few weeks now with the Nature's Gate Organics acne treatment system.  The three step process is pretty quick and straightforward to follow every day and it has kept any unwanted blemishes away.  I did limit use to once a day (at bedtime) because it was drying the skin (mostly around my nose) a lot.  I haven't really tried any other ""systems"" to compare this against, but it is certainly a few steps up from just a facial scrub.  You really feel clean and like it's doing something to clear your skin.  And a nice-to-have topper is - it actually smells kind of good!"
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,3.0,1,1,91,"I should have known ...","This wouldn't work for me. I barely have any acne, but I thought I'd try this and see if it improved things.		I should have known better, but salicylic acid products don't work on my face. I gave it 3 stars because I do appreciate that the product is a natuaral product. But, this product didn't really work for me. It actually made my skin worse, which is regular for me when I use salicylic acid. If salicylic acid works for you though, by all means give this product a try."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,3.0,1,1,443,"COMPARED to other systems","If you cannot use any form of benzoyl peroxide and have MILD acne, this system will work for you.  If you have severe acne, don't waste your time.  If you CAN use peroxide in small doses, but have redness from the 10% solution, read this:		This product has only 1% acid. Not very effective. For the brief period of time this in on your face it cannot exfoliate thoroughly.  It was about the worst I've used for exfoliating. I had visible flaking on my nose area after using for a week, twice daily.	It does NOT clear up black heads. I've used many treatments that do a far better job on black heads. This reduces them, but not greatly.	It doesn't smell good. The citrus based ingredients, along with some other pleasant sounding ones made me think it was going to smell good. It didn't. In fact, it was the ONLY acne treatment that smelled so awful that my husband ASKED me if I had used something on my face when I came to bed. He has NEVER mentioned it before.	The 3rd product that you put on your face leaves it looking and feeling greasy.  I felt very clean and a little dry/tight from the cleanser. The toner made my skin feel a little less tight. The 3rd product made me feel like I needed to start over again.	It didn't clear up my acne.  I went off of all other products while using this. I continued to have breakouts and the acne that I already had was less severe, but did not go away.		COMPARE:		The ACNE FREE system is similar in price. I found it to be too heavy on the peroxide, leaving my sensitive skin very tight, dry and red.		The PROACTIVE system is more expensive, but a pain in the derrier because you have to subscribe and pay huge shipping fees. Probably one of the best systems out there, but don't fall for the half-price hooks. They give you a half-sized product and you still pay full-sized shipping charges.		The CLEAN and CLEAR system - similar to the ACNE FREE. It's just hard on your skin.		The NEUTROGENA system (basic) was the best thing next to PROACTIVE and cost about $4 less than this one. It was fine for my sensitive skin and did a tremendous job of clearing up acne without irritation.		Overall, if you're bent on buying the most earth-friendly product, this is probably for you, but you'll have to live with a little of your acne.  If you're wanting to get rid of it, try Neutrogena. If you have money to waste, go for Proactive."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,4.0,1,1,366,"A great alternative to harsher acne treatment kits","I've always had problematic skin and lately I've been trying to switch over to more natural products, particularly those without parabens, so I was excited to give this kit a try. I've been using a different acne system for the past several years. And while my old kit seemed to work for the most part, my skin was often irritated and seemed overly dry. I tried using it once a day or every other day, but the results weren't as good.		This kit is really good. I'm definitely not buying that other kit any more. This one is so much gentler and seems to work just as well, if not better. I'm so excited that my skin looks good for the holidays! Bring on the family photos! The cleanser foams up nicely and my skin feels soft and smooth afterwards. The toner is refreshing and the cream is light and non-greasy. It tingles just a little going on, but it doesn't burn or anything.		There are only a couple of things that kept me from giving this a perfect 5 stars. First, I don't like the fragrance and really, I feel that for this to be a truly ""natural"" product, it shouldn't have any added fragrance (essential oils would be okay). Fragrance often contains pthalates and while I don't know if this does, I really wish I didn't have to wonder about it. Also, I have to admit, unlike most reviewers here, I don't care for the smell. I think it smell mediciney. That's just me - fragrance is such a subjective thing and I tend to be pretty sensitive to smells.		The only other thing about this product that I'm missing is some kind of light exfoliant. I like that my old system had some very light exfoliating beads in the cleanser. I really feel like acne prone skin needs exfoliant. I'm using a different brand of exfoliant on a weekly basis and it seems to meet my needs, but I still wish it were just in my daily cleanser.		All in all, however, this product seems to be working and I'm really pleased to have a skincare regimen that leaves me with clear skin."
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,4.0,1,1,532,"***So Far, So GOOD***Powerful Weapon in the Fight Against ACNE!","I have just completed the third week of using the NATURE'S GATE ORGANICS ACNE TREATMENT SYSTEM and going into the fourth. So far I've been very impressed with the results. And I figure that being at the half way point of the regiment, the box claims ""clearer skin in 6-weeks,"" that if results aren't at least noticeable--another 3 weeks won't help.		The three-step system is like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A3ML3K"">Proactiv Solution 3 Step System Kit, 2 Month Supply</a> where you use a cleanser, toner and a correcting lotion everyday to clear up acne. But instead of Benzoyl Peroxide as the active ingredient, NATURE'S GATE... uses 1% Salicylic Acid.		I suffer from mild to moderate adult acne, with the occasional eruption of boils that I have to use a prescription topical solution to clear up, and I've found that the NATURE'S GATE... has help arrest the development of pimples and clear them up within 2-days. Also, my skin condition is pretty constant and does NOT get better or worse with changes in the weather (besides I'm in Los Angeles, CA and we pretty much have constant weather patterns anyway).		A pimple would begin to form, tenderness and redness along with the bump, on my face and the system would keep it from becoming a full blown zit. It would only stay red with slight swelling and then it would clear up. I also noticed that I was getting a boil, which is an extreme case of a pimple for those who don't know, and NATURE'S GATE... kept that from forming as well.		The reason I give only 4-Stars is because I'm running out of the toner and the cleanser, so I don't know if there's enough to make it to the end of 6-weeks. Also, I've noticed that my skin has a dewy/clammy feel to it after a couple of hours from using the toner and I'm not sure if I like that and there's no sun-screen in it so you must use a separate product if you plan on going out. But using the cleanser and toner twice a day and using the lotion only at night before bed, I've experienced no drying or irritation and that's a plus.		Another good thing is that even though each product has tea tree oil in it, it doesn't have that strong herbal odor associated with the oil nor does it have a strong perfume scent of any kind.		=============================	CLEANSER--Light, clean scent (reminded me of candles) and clear. Light lather and rinses away easily.		TONER/ASTRINGENT--Clear with a very light citrus scent. I experienced no burning and the toner does not contain alcohol, which can dry and irritate the skin and turn it red (for those like me who are sensitive to alcohol).		LOTION--Light and creamy white, smells like the toner, goes on smooth and easy and absorbs quickly.		============================		I'll update at the end of six-weeks.		UPDATE 01/02/09:	I am two days short of 6 weeks and I've just run out of the cleanser.  The product has kept my face pretty clear but there were a couple of resistant pimples that took longer than the 2-3 days to heal. All in all a very satisfactory experience."

I know this may not be the best for your skin....but at 52...and I still use lots of lotion, my skin is just fine.

B000FBNV1Y,2009,0,4.0,0,0,176,"Seems to work","Nature's Gate Organics Advanced Care Natural Results Acne Treatment System is a three part acne treatment that provides pretty decent results. You start with the corrective cleanser, follow it with the calming toner that can also serve as a sun screen when you head out into the sunshine, and finish off with the controlling lotion. The first application cleans your skin, the second apparently helps soothe it, and, finally, the latter works to prevent further breakouts.		Frankly, other than the promises made on the label, I can't say with any certainty exactly what each treatment accomplishes, but the corrective cleanser does seem to do the trick. It helps to clear up nasty blemishes and leaves the skin feeling smooth and clean. I don't battle acne as much as I did in my youth, but I still get the occasional zit, usually on the nose where it attracts the most attention. After using this product, I haven't had a single breakout. I take that as a sign that this product works. Therefore, it's recommended.		Brian W. Fairbanks"
B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,2.0,2,2,259,"Be Wary If You Have Sensitive Skin","""Natural"" does not equal healthy or good for every person because each person is different.  This three step program from Nature's Gate is a great example of this fact.  The program is for 6 weeks but after 4 weeks I've learned enough.  Note: I used the product as directed for 2 weeks then needed to make adjustments because of reactions.		The Corrective Cleanser is ok but never feels like it truly washes away from my skin.  It did seem to clear things well.		The Calming Toner never really seemed to do much and this is partly because I found the instructions unclear.  How much should I put on the cotton ball?  Should it leave my face wet, dry, somewhere in between?  The imbalance in instructions equaled less toner than cleanser over all.		Oddly the Controling Lotion was both a positive and a negative for me.  On my cheeks and forehead it worked great.  Good moisture with no feeling of greasiness.  But on my chin and the space between mouth and nose I saw increases in breakouts, in places I never have them.  When I stopped using the lotion, the breakouts lessened but didn't completely stop.		That's a problem since this product is supposed to stop them.  Clearly for my skin this is not a very good product so I will now stop using it after this review.  The two stars is because I think the lotion was good for some parts of my face and over all the program was easy to follow.  Your own skin will react differently."

It's not a magic fix.  There's no 'one day there, one day gone' answer.  However, overall, I've noticed a lessening of inflammation and breakouts, without any side effects at all.		Meaning I'm quite pleased with it, and once out I will likely look to get this again rather than continue to experiment with other acne treatment systems.		It is important to note, however, that this can't be seen as a single approach. Combined with a variety of responses, including diet and exercise, this is a helpful part of a holistic approach.

So if you are going to use this product, to get results you need to use it consitently like other acne products."
B000FBNV1Y,2009,0,3.0,1,1,968,"About the Ingredients","If natural ingredients are important to you, for whatever reason, and/or you have skin allergies to some ingredients, this acne treatment system may be for you. It is a set of 3 bottled acne products which are used together as a 3-step facial routine: ""Corrective Cleanser"" (step 1), ""Calming Toner"" (step 2), and ""Controlling Lotion"" (step 3). A sticker on the box said ""Get CLEAR skin in 6 Weeks"" and ""Clinically Proven Effective Formula"".		The price is reasonable, especially when compared to competing systems of acne treatment. It's something you can try for yourself without a huge price or a subscription hassle.		What sets this acne treatment apart from the others is that it does NOT have some common but irritating ingredients that are used in many (most?) of the others.		This does not contain parabens. Parabens are very common; they show up in almost all skin lotions and creams, and in other acne treatment ""systems"". Parabens trigger rashes for many people with sensitive skin, including me.		I do not see benzyl (or benzyol) peroxide on the ingredient list either. Benzyl peroxide is another potential irritant found in some competing acne products, and has the additional hassle of stained towels, etc., requiring extra care.		This set does not contain PAPBA (nor any other sunscreen), which is not surprising. The directions recommend, if you are using their acne treatment system, that you ""avoid unnecessary sun exposure"" and put on some type of sunscreen before you go outside. I'm guessing the product causes sun-sensitivity, at least temporarily.		The only ""active"" ingredient listed on the box is salicylic acid 1%, which is a lower percentage (less strong) compared to some acne treatments; on the other hand that means it is less irritating, which I appreciate. The salicylic acid 1% is in the step 1 cleanser, and in the step 3 lotion.		Tea tree oil (Melaleuca Altemifolia) is listed as an ingredient for each of the 3 bottles. I consider tea tree oil to be an ""active"" ingredient when used in skin or hair (scalp) products, although the FDA may not yet recognize it as such (maybe FDA does not permit it to be listed as an ""active"" ingredient?). The paper enclosed in the box (the Nature's Gate Organics Natural Results Acne Treatment System box) says that ""encapsulated Tea Tree Leaf Oil is particularly beneficial to acne-prone skin and helps reduce redness"". On the other hand, I've heard that some people have a sensitivity to tea tree oil.		By the way, ""tea tree oil"" does not seem like a true ""oil"" to me; it does not make skin oily; I don't know how tee tree oil got its folk name; it seems a misnomer. Some herbal ""experts"" claim that tea tree oil has some mild (or weak) anti-microbial properties when used on the skin. I was already inclined to believe some of the claims for tea tree oil, since I've been using a foot spray with tea tree oil for the past 1-2 years.		Another unusual feature of this acne treatment system is that it contains extracts from about 12-20 different plants, and most or all of them are footnoted as ""certified organic"".		On the box, Nature's Gate describes ""Oligopeptide-10"" their patented combination of ""15 naturally occurring amino acids"". Oligopeptide-10 is included in the step 2 ""Calming Toner"" bottle, and the step 3 ""Controlling Lotion"" bottle. The box says ""Oligopeptide-10 and Salicylic Acid help neutralize pro-inflammatory bacteria ..."" ; that sounds good to me, but I don't have the scientific background to evaluate the claim.		This acne treatment system has a subtle scent that smells vaguely like green plants; it is not a strong scent. If does not smell flowery or perfume-ish; and the scent is neither feminine nor masculine; just a slight scent of neutral botanicals.		Cons: I wish the ingredients were listed in a larger font. Trying to read them is giving me a headache. It may sound trivial to others, but for someone like me, with so many skin allergies and sensitivities, those ingredient lists are so important. However, this seems to be a problem with about 95% of the products in any grocery store, drugstore, and with 95% of all cosmetics and other toiletries; the readability problem is not limited to just this brand, and this font size may be a little larger than typical.		The painfully small font size gives the impression that companies don't want us to fully examine the ingredients list. A company like Nature's Gate, with their fine product line, which has far better ingredients than average (at least from my allergy-prone viewpoint), seems likely to profit if they were to target the customer market segments consisting of people who consider the ingredients important.		I have 2 types of skin problems: (1) stubborn acne, and (2) skin allergies or sensitivities to ingredients often found in skin care products. I've had allergic reactions (hives) and/or sensitivities (rashes) to many lotions, creams, sunscreens, and acne treatments, and also some make-up, scented laundry detergent, Dawn blue liquid dishwashing detergent. I have not yet figured out all the ingredients that make my skin react. Thus, trying a new product is an adventure. I was glad to see that the specific chemicals that I know are definitely a problem for me (and probably many other people) are not contained in this product - no parabens, no PABA.		When I first tried this acne treatment system, my skin immediately looked so much smoother. I was surprised at the quick improvement. Unfortunately, several hours later I had a delayed reaction, and got a rash and itchy hives.		Even though I will not be able to continue use of this product, I still think it would be a good treatment system for many other people. My husband will be trying it next."

B000FBNV1Y,2008,11,3.0,1,1,159,"Longer Term Skin Treatment","The Natural Results Acne Treatment System clears and improves the skin quite well. This system consists of three products to be used on a daily basis: Step 1, the Corrective Cleanser; Step 2, the Calming Toner; and Step 3, the Controlling Lotion. I found the Corrective Cleanser to be far too drying and irritating on my skin, even when not used daily. However, I have sensitive skin in general, so this product may benefit others better. The Calming Toner is a very pleasant blend of natural oils, among other ingredients, that made my skin feel good. Finally, the Controlling Lotion treated acne well and was not overly drying. Overall, this is a good product, but it requires some personal adjustment as to how often and how much of each product in the system one wishes to use. Also, the Natural Results Acne Treatment System seems to provide a long-term, skin-clearing service, as opposed to a fast-acting, overnight spot treatment."

This product feels nice, although the toner burns a bit, and doesn't leave my face dry and flaky. The smell is odd, but not unpleasant. The drawback is that now I'm getting blemishes in places where I really never got them before! I've been using this for several weeks, long enough for whatever might be ""lurking"" under my skin to have arrived and disappeared, but am still getting at least as many blemishes as before starting this program.

Mainly, I love the way it smells. I have been really big on wearing less makeup, and wearing it only when I'm going to be somewhere. I'm not sure if it's the skincare or the lack of makeup (I don't wear a lot anyway), but I feel a lot less self-conscious walking around barefaced .		The cleanser lathers up nicely and leaves no residue that I can feel. The toner goes on with no real aftereffect, and I'm still trying to decide if I think that is a good thing. I'm used to those old toners that really hit you when they went on, you know?  The lotion is nice and thick, and smells great. I have oily skin, and this doesn't seem to make it worse.		So far, it's a great skincare set. I will be updating in the future as things progress.		Update: 02/16/2009		I am still using this skincare set, with mostly positive results. About two weeks ago, I had a strange acne breakout pretty much all over my face. For the most part, it has healed, but I have red spots as a result. I'm not sure what caused the breakout, as I have had pretty positive results (in that my skin stayed very neutral). I will update further as needed."

It can't compare to the other, less ""natural,"" kits on the market, though, and it's approximately the same price. I have skin that's moderately sensitive, oily and prone to breakouts. It seemed to help healing somewhat, and my face certainly felt clean, but it didn't have the stronger healing action or drying action that one of the major brands gives me.

Nothing unusual, especially if you have used skin scrubs in the past. The smell was pretty neutral for all 3 components, which is a big plus for me. As to the success I had in using it to clear my acne? I have only mild, occasional acne, and it seemed to do the job within 3 days. Then again, would my blemishes have disappeared within 4? Probably.		From what I saw from the other reviewers, I wouldn't expect any magical results if you have severe acne. But from my experience, the system's worth a try if other brands have failed you."
B000FBNV1Y,2009,1,4.0,0,0,175,"It works!","Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System really does work if you have mild to moderate acne but there is a caveat - it will dry out your skin if you are prone to such and it does require more effort then I am accustomed to for a daily type treatment.  This kit includes 3 different products that is recommended for twice a day application.  The first product is a basic facewash, lather up and scrub down.  The second step is to grab a cotton ball and squeeze out a dab of a facial toner that you then apply.  If you are prone to dry skin this second step may not be ideal but all's fair in love and war right?  The third product is more of a cream based application that seems mild and relatively pleasant enough.  The whole process will take approximately 5 minutes to go through.  If you feel up to this task, 2x a day then by all means I highly recommend it - the price is reasonable and it is effective."
B000FBNV1Y,2009,1,3.0,0,0,391,"It's As Simple As A Pimple","Growing up, I dealt with what most would consider normal teenage acne.  As I have matured, the acne has slowly gone away, with only a blemish or two popping up here or there.  My wife also tackled the average teen's acne, but after the birth of our second child, her breakouts increased.  Granted, she doesn't suffer from severe acne, but she does have a higher degree of breakouts than before she had our second child.  With that in mind, I decided to pick up Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System for her.		The system is very simple to use.  So simple, in fact, that the bottles are numbered one, two, and three.  The first bottle, the Corrective Cleanser, attacks acne with good ol' fashioned salicylic acid.  Fans of Oxy and other cleansers will recognize this stuff.  Coupled with it is encapsulated tea tree oil, which helps unclog pores.  The second step in the process involves the Calming Toner, which contains Oligopeptide-10, more of the aforementioned tree oil and ""botanical extracts"" which together supposedly control the amount of oil on the skin and further clean out those pores.  The last bottle is the Controlling Lotion, which uses the Oligopeptide-10 and our old friend salicylic acid to maintain a clear complexion.		When my wife tried this product, she did mention a slight burning sensation.  However, this was expected thanks to the salicylic acid and the tree oil.  I can see where those with sensitive skin could experience an adverse reaction to this, so use this product at your own risk if your skin is sensitive.		After using the product a few days, she did notice a slight reduction in acne, but nothing more or less than the results when using Oxy products.  While she liked the Nature's Gate Organics system, she saw no reason to abandon her other cleanser.		The product is certified organic, which is a plus, but in this day and age the almighty dollar is what speaks the loudest.  In my opinion, if you get similar or better results using a cheaper product, use it instead of Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System.  The system works fairly well, but nothing makes it stand out from any of the other systems on the market other than its eco-friendliness.		Recommended to anyone with moderate acne problems who prefers to use organic brands."

B000FBNV1Y,2008,10,3.0,3,5,301,"A decent product...but keeping up with 3 steps is a lot.","I don't really have any complaints about this product.  It seemed to do a decent job as a facial cleanser.  It did make my face feel clean, and it didn't break out my skin, which tends to be a problem for me and acne products.  I was hoping it would take care of a few trouble spots for me, and overall it seems like it does a decent job.		Pros:	One of the biggests pros is that I can say is that it didn't dry out my skin like some acne treatments seem to.  Step 1 is basically a face wash and step 2 is a toner you apply with a cotton ball.  The lotion is step 3 and can be used more frequently if you have more oily skin and on specific trouble spots, but I used it once a day, and I didn't have any problem with dry skin.  The main ingredient is salicylic acid, which doesn't bleach your towels or clothes, so I think that is a big plus for this product.  I also like that this product uses organic ingredients.  In a world with so many chemicals, more natural products are a plus.  Although salicylic acid can be a little harsh on the system, over all I think it is a good balance of stronger products and natural remedies.		Cons:	My main complaint with this system is that contains 3 products that are intended to be used twice a day for full effect.  I prefer a face wash and go routine to a complicated system, but if you don't mind the system, it would be a good fit for you.		Overall my opinion is positive.  If you are looking for a more organic alternative to a acne system, then you might want to give this a try."

I was pleased to see Nature's Gate offered a natural alternative. I used the wash, toner & lotion just ONCE/day for a week. I do have sensitive skin, but think most people w/ acne do. Anyway, all 6-7 evenings I tried it, my skin immediately flared up into a slight burning feel & a red appearance just minutes after application. I think a combo of the salicylic acid, the oligopeptide-10 and the tea tree oil (combined w/ many other listed products, some totally natural, some totally not), was far too much for my skin to handle. My fave brand for natural skin care is Aubrey Organics. I just learned they now make a Sensitive Skin wash, toner & lotion, so I'm off to try that next.

With our results I would have to say probably not unless they had a means of testing the product first. This system is a good chunk of money to end up with dry skin.

These are SO much better than just filling a spray bottle and so worth the money.  The fine mist dampens hair evenly and gently, instead of spraying out big, uneven bursts that saturate some parts of my head and leave others relatively dry.

You dont have to use as much lotion when you use this because it helps the lotion absorb quicker (and i cant describe well with words but basically you already have a solution on your face so that amount that you would have to use in lotion is subsidized by the water so you are using half the lotion you would have used--sorry if that didnt make sense)		oh i also use this under my armpits (lol i must sound like such a weirdo) but i use the thai stone crystal deodorant and your armpits need to be wet in order for you to use it so i quickly spray under the pits then roll on the deo.		okie doks ..hope that helped at least one person.

I never use them up fully before they go bad, they really do last a long time.		I bought my first one a decade ago as a teen who traveled very frequently to Boise to visit family. I found the switch to the dry, high desert air to be very harsh on my system and got frequent nosebleeds as well as cracked skin. My relatives who had relocated there (from much more humid Oregon) had to have prescription moisturizers and treatments for years before they finally adapted to the dryness.		I had originally read about this product in Bazaar, as something used by models to help keep their skin refreshed during long flights. I thought, ""Hey, if it works for them, it should work for my little puddle jump!"" and gave it a try.		I have never flown without one since. :) Or even just roadtripped to the South West without a bottle either. It might seem fairly ridiculous (and I admit, yes, there are more pressing social and environmental issues than one's level of skin hydration) but for a meager $6 or so, you can get the small, TSA-approved size and a nice pick-me-up while traveling. I get mine at Nordstrom's or Sephora in the trial size section.		I know that for me, personally, so much of my travel is budget-budget-budget... cheapest tickets possible, cheapest hotel that meets my barebones requirements, eating meals in the room to save cash, etc. It is nice to have one luxury treat while traveling. Yes, some of the effect is psychological, but regardless, it does make you feel refreshed. It's not about ""status"" since no one sees the bottle but a TSA agent, but more about doing something nice for yourself."

I have very dry, sensitive skin, and the little Evian spritzers (I carry one with me all the time in the winter) help immeasurably.  I spray a little on before moisturizing, or when my skin is flaking.  I always take these on planes--and spritz my face every two hours--and find that this keeps my skin from drying out and from becoming too oily (in reaction to the dryness) on long flights.		Some reviewers have scoffed at this product, pointing out that it's just water and speculating that the brand name is the draw.  I don't drink Evian water very often (I prefer other brands, if I'm drinking bottled water), and if I could find a comparable product I would definitely try it out.  Similar products, like the Body Shop face mists, tend to be scented and irritate my (very sensitive) skin (the exception to this is the face spritz from the Boots Botanical line, but that is hard to find outside of the UK); I've considered just getting a spray bottle and putting regular water in it, but those tend to have larger, more forceful sprayers and I don't want to point one at my face.		With the Evian brumisateur, you're getting just water, but that's all you need; it's conveniently packaged, lasts a long time for such a small bottle, and I love the way it feels.  Highly reccomended (and thank goodness they're carry-on approved, if you buy the small size!)"

Since we don't drink water out of the tap here, why would you want it on your delicate facial skin?		Well you have to use it to wash the face, but after cleansing, I spritz this on and let it set awhile before I put on any creams or serums. With my irritable rash prone skin, I find this process reduces redness. In the morning, I don't wash my face at all, but just spray this on (I have 'normal' not oily skin).

B00005BHRQ,2011,6,5.0,2,2,94,"Can't Do Without","I've been using this product for years.  About 7 years ago an article in a beauty magazine rated this one of the two best on the market (the other one was an Avon product).  Copper is the ingredient that makes it so good.  I'm sure that in the last 7 years more products have come on the market that are pretty good, but I'm sticking to this one as long as I can find it.  The price would be exponentially greater too!  The internet is the only place I can find it right now."

This is the best thing I have ever tried for my face.  The problem being it is hard to find.  Copper is a widely recognized anti-inflammatory.  It is also anti-viral and anti-bacterial."

B00005BHRQ,2010,8,5.0,2,2,106,"Best face cream","I started using this cream years ago, and never realize how good it was. One day the store where I used to buy the cream stopped carrying it, and I tried different products. After a few weeks my skin started looking older and not firm at all. So, I looked in the Internet and found that the product was still available. I order it and started using it again. I was so happily surprised that my skin started looking younger and firmer again. It is an incredible product. All the women in my family use it. I use this cream as a day cream as well."
B00005BHRQ,2008,1,5.0,7,7,121,"it takes a long time but you will see result","I have always been skeptical to products that say, you will see result in 8 weeks or so. But in the case of Neutrogena it really seems to work like that. You need to have patience and you will see result. This creamy moisturization made my skin soft and clearer looking. As for the lifting and firming that seemed to take a long time, until I orderd the serum version of this. Now this thing is like a turbo charged cream. You will see results sooner. Even my boyfriend was impressed and is using it now. Copperpeptides is supposed to heal the skin. I actually never thought I would get my youthfull glow back, but I did and I am 40."
B00005BHRQ,2004,1,5.0,11,13,85,"Amazing Results!","I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now, and it is outstanding. Immediately after putting it on, my face felt hydrated and lost the uncomfortable tightness I have after removing my makeup at night. Now, rather than looking tired when I wake up in the mornings, I look refreshed and my face looks and feels very smooth.  In as little as two weeks, I have noticed the disappearance of some of the fine lines around my eyes.  I highly recommend this product."
B00005BHRQ,2009,0,4.0,5,5,138,"Great...if you don't have acne!","I am so bummed that I can't use this product anymore. It really made my skin noticeably firmer and so nice and soft, but it seemed to be causing breakouts for me. The breakouts subsided when I switched to another night cream, but the new one doesn't even compare to the Neutrogena in terms of making my skin appear more youthful.		....Actually sitting here, I think I will give the Neutrogena one more chance because it worked so well despite the breakouts.  Maybe my skin just needs to adjust to it, so I'll report back and let you know.		******July 2009	I had to give up on the Neutrogena.  It was causing breakouts, and it stung, too, but I would still recommend this if acne and stinging aren't a problem for you because the antiaging benefits were great."
B00005BHRQ,2007,11,5.0,5,5,61,"Great stuff!","The anti-Neutrogena post cracks me up- aging is a process, and even stuff the really does age you like sun damage takes years. Nothing sold OTC, and certainly nothing Neutrogena makes, will make you look like the Cryptkeeper after 3 weeks. Anyway, I use this and the Visibly Firm serum, and even my dermatologist commented on how good my skin looks."

I have acne prone skin so I was a little hesitant about trying this because I usually break out when I put creams on my face. This does not break me out!	I have been using this for about 6 months and I just love it! I really love the smell too! I put this on at night after I do a 20 minute session of my aurora sirius  LED red light therapy. When I wake up in the morning my skin looks fabulous! It's tight and firm, my fine lines are drastically reduced and my skin is so soft! I really love this stuff and will be purchasing it again!"

Neutrogena doesn't tell you that the copper peptide activates enzymes called MMPs that break down collagen and elastin - but that is what it does! (These are the same enzymes that are activated by being out in the sun - they are what cause photoaging and elastosis!) I used this stuff for 3 weeks and my skin atrophied terribly, became very dry and wrinkled, with larger pores and loss of firmness. Additionally, I have numerous spider veins caused by this stuff - and an all-over red and yellow / brown discoloration. My skin was so fragile in places that it literally ripped apart - causing stretch mark like areas... It has been months since I stopped using it and there has been little improvement. I look like I have aged at least 10 years! I can't believe Neutrogena would sell such a dangerous product! Look up the information on the internet - copper peptides and mmp-2 / mmp-9 - they break down collagen and elastin, and cause angiogenesis!!!"

It is the ONLY thing that seems to smooth out the rapidly appearing wrinkles in my neck area. I have very sensitive skin, and this cream is non-irritating.

I haven't used other moisturizers since.	I have very dry skin which is very sensitive; many moisturizers irritate my skin.  This cream doesn't.  Because it's a night cream it provides good moisture, but feels very light.  If you're looking something heavy or greasy, this isn't it."

Even works better than $60 creams I have tried. I'm 33 and have been using this for a little over one week now, after trying probably 10-12 different creams over the past 5 years.  I am using this product mostly on one particular fine line/wrinkle on my forehead. I saw results within 2 nights, 7th night even more amazing - looks almost erased. I do have sensitive skin, and I'm almost afraid to use any product every single night, so after the 3rd straight night of use, I started using this every other night and continue to be very pleased. I just wish it was easier to find/purchase on store shelves. I have no problem buying this online, Amazon, or wherever I need to buy it. I have never been this satisfied with a product. I feel like I've found a treasure!"

I've used Retin-A for years (and still do), but this product is a great addition to my regimen.  Like another reviewer, I researched information on Copper Peptides and found that they are restorative/an aid in healing.

Retrieved it later and used it a couple more days and noticed that my face does look plumper and moist.  It's a thick cream that forms a nice barrier on the skin.  Skin does look better and fuller and I'm using it daytime and nightime now, but I cannot undo the two-star rating or I would now give it a five."

My frown lines were very deep.  Note, WERE.  I have tried MANY products to reduce fine lines and fade aging spots to no avail.  So I got serious about researching ingredients that work. I am blessed with good skin, but the frown lines really aged me.  Then I tried Neutrogena's Visibly Firm Night Cream.  I call it BLUE MAGIC!! I am truly amazed!  I'm still on my first jar and my frown lines are minimal now.  My two quarter sized brown spots are GONE!! Any fine lines around my mouth and eyes are GONE!! My skin is very soft and translucent--I use no foundation now, only mineral blush.  I've been mistaken for my 41 year old daughter's sister several times now. My only regret is that I didn't do before and after photos, because nobody would believe it! There are only a few products with this ingredient, and Neutrogena's is by far the least expensive. I have sensitive skin and had no problem.  I only put it on at night.  Started putting it on my neck, too.  Also, GREAT on the back of your hands!  Seriously, if you want to keep your skincare routine minimal, this product needs to be at the top of your list! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"

This is the preferred brand of dermatologists to use for themselves, and after using this I can really understand that - I have very fair skin and thought I would somehow, magically tan when I was younger.  All I have are some 40ish crows feet and wrinkles and some discoloration to show for all that time in the sun.  There is a genuine visible difference in my skin since I began using this product.  I have used it for 6 weeks and yes, the lines are reduced and my skin looks younger.  I am really pleased, I am not one to go on about something, but his one really is a get what they say you will get.  Is it botox, nope, but it has put my wonderings about using botox to rest for a while it has made such a difference."

It's natural ingredients so that makes it even better for your skin and it wont clog your pores. It's also super thick so it sounds and looks like such a small jar but you have to actually dillute it a little with water and it kinda forms a paste that smells deliscious and goes a long way. I was kinda worried about the smell because of some of the other reviews but I really like it. It's like pumpkin spice and it's not super strong either. This product instantly made my skin softer and gave it an extra youthful dewyness, I love it! I will probably use this stuff for the rest of my life lol! Thumbs up ;^D"

Not so with this scrub, and I couldn't be happier.		I have pale, almost see through skin, as well as rosacea & extreme sensitivity. Though this product looked like it would be too harsh for my skin type, I decided to give it a whirl. I loved everything about it:		The jar it comes in is adorable, and I feel great about all the natural ingredients. I love the smell - like figs or spiced cookies. It's a thick paste, you have to water it down to manage it, so the little jar will last a long time I think. The best part though is that it was so gentle on my skin, and still did a great job of clearing it up. There was a noticeable difference in my very first use, my skin was fresh and soft.		This is the first time I've ever tried Burt's Bees products, I'd always avoided them for the cost and thinking it was just part of the ""all natural hype"". But I'm sold. I'm going to start collecting all the products suitable for my skin because so far the few products I've used have been amazing."

It has a pumpkin spice smell (which you wouldn't expect from citrus scrub, but it's very pleasant) and, as another reviewer mentioned, a little goes a long way.  You just mix a little of the paste with water and scrub away, so you're definately get your moneys worth.  My skin always glows after using it, and I use it about three times a week (give or take).

A thick, earthy feeling paste, like something ancient Aztecs could have made scented with ground almonds, pecans, rose petals, oats and orange oil. It smells like Christmas, cinnamon and orange spice that knocks deep down my nose and gently yet thoroughly uncovers soft, smooth skin. This little jar will last a long time but it's an addictive pleasure, so I recommend stocking up.		I use this whenever my skin is acting up or it looses its glass like smoothness. No rough housing is needed; gentle is the word  when this is used often, it works wonders and is chemical free.  For those who are used to runnier scrubs in a tube this might be a strange experience at first but one that will get easier with time, it's worth it and it smells good enough to eat.

But I don't mind at all, since I like sweet smells. After using it, it does leave some kind of oily feeling (moist) (I think it comes from all the natural oil content of the nuts/ cloves in it), but that makes my face feel healthy. You can also use the lettuce toner after using this, so it will feel less oily and feel even softer!		It is a little dry, and it does crumble, but I just mix it up with water.

I used this after my Burt's Bees Soap Bark & Camomile cleanser, and my skin was so SOFT and SMOOTH after :) Even better, you only need a pea-sized amount mixed with a couple drops of water in your hand, so the 2 oz. jar will last you for a REALLY long time. It smells wonderful, too (like orange peels and nutmeg spices). I've tried the Burt's Bees Acne Solutions Scrub too, and that one has too little beads in it to exfoliate well, it also leaves behind an oily residue I didn't like. I love how the grains in this one are very fine and the orange oil very moisturizing without being heavy/clogging pores. OVERALL, a great GENTLE face scrub that delivers all the benefits without the harsh chemicals!		(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

It is kind of a hassle trying to pick the right amount out of the little jar and adding some water and getting it on to your face in a timely/not so messy manner. The smell is alright, but afterwards there always seems to be a little bit of a residue left on my face, no matter how much I rinse it off again.

First off, the texture of this scrub is too thick. Even after adding water, chunks of the product kept falling off my skin! It was HARD to get the scrubbing part going. I had to pick up chunks that fell into my sink because I didn't want to waste the product. It does not scrub well. Like in another review mentioned it feeling like Playdoh. Immediately after rinsing, I started feeling ITCHY around my neck then my whole face broke out in a rash! This scrub actually left a thick layer of the product on my skin and felt like 'Vaseline'. It did not exfoliate my skin. I couldn't actually FEEL my skin. I then used their Acne Clarifying Toner and it became too much. The toner glided around my skin without effectively cleaning it. It also left a filmy layer on top. I then used Alba Botanica Acnedote Face & Body Scrub and it helped calm down the rash and exfoliated my skin. I will return the scrub & toner!"

After a recommendation from a youtube make up guru, and success with other Burt's Bees products, I decided to take the risk. I love the smell of the scrub, it has a spicy nutty scent (like a holiday candle). I scoop up a bit with my finger and add a few drops of water to make a paste, gently exfoliate my face for about a minute and then rinse with warm water. I use it every other day, usually in the shower. It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth, even when I'm mid break out. If I have been wearing make up, I use my usual cleanser before the scrub. I'm not sure how great it would be to remove make up and dirt from the day, but it is great to exfoliate a few times a week. I have some pigment scars from acne, and exfoliation is supposed to reduce the appearance. I have been using other products for the scarring in conjunction, so I can't say that this scrub is what has helped my complexion, but it certainly hasn't made things worse. I would definitely recommend it."

B0009EILUI,2012,7,4.0,0,0,282,"Good facial scrub.","Skin type: Combination , Sensitive	Recommended for: Combination , Dry		What you see is what you get when it comes to the size of this facial scrub. The pot is a small thing that can fit in the palm of your hand with your fingers closed around it. Its not a cause for concern though, because with the amount of product you'll be using each time, its bound to last you for a couple months at least, especially if you don't plan on using it daily. In terms of usage, I find it a bit of a hassle as I'm one of those who washes my face in the shower and not over the sink. Your hands have to be dry before dipping them into the pot or it'll muck up the rest of the content. Also the pot is made of glass, so with all the fumbling around just be careful not to drop the pot. As for the scrub itself, it does not have a citrus smell but more of a pumpkin smell. In a good way. However, in terms of visual... the product (when added with water) looks a bit like wet sand .. or something else, if you know what I mean. It makes me a little uncomfortable, haha. The scrub isn't abrassive and I mean this in a good and bad way as while it is gentle to the skin, I feel like it may not be exfoliating enough. Also, once you wash it off, it leaves this filmy moisture which I'm not too crazy about at first. But once I've toweled my face dry, my face is super soft and moisturized and has this glowy look."

It's got a great smell, and offers this strange mix of a light scrub yet moisturizing at the same time. Your face just glows afterwards.		To get the right effect, scoop a small amount with your fingers and mix it with a bit of water in your hand. Gently rub in circles around your face then rinse. I especially use it around my nose where my pores are large and prone to blackheads. The oils in the scrub don't seem to make it worse and do a great job cleaning the area.		Highly recommended."

What you'll find is that the facial scrub is a highly concentrated paste.  All you have to do is scoop a small portion out and add a little bit of water.  Mix it on your hand, and you've got one of the best facial scrubs out there.  And the smell...it's excellent; very subtle, but pleasant.

I recommend this or the Lemon Poppy Seed Cleanser. I also like the Garden Tomato facial soap and toner. That is the best for those of you with oily skin."
B0009EILUI,2012,3,4.0,4,4,255,"Can also be used as a Mask!","This is one of the best face scrubs overall and the best one offered by Burt's Bees.	It does smell like a blend of pumpkin pie spices and citrus but everyone in our family loves it!	I laughed at the reviews that said it was too pasty or hard because although the jar is small it is filled with a more concentrated paste that, when some is scooped out and mixed with a few drops of water becomes a more spreadable product - AND THE DIRECTIONS TELL YOU THAT IF YOU READ THEM.		We use a small plastic spatula to scoop into the palm of the hand and mix just a few drops in to form a spreadable paste. Then we apply to the face like a mask and walk around for 10-15 minutes smelling the yummy citrus spice bouquet and then either remove with a moist wash cloth or can be done right before a shower and can be scrubed off in the shower.	Leaves skin smooth and soft and ready to soak up whatever fabulous moisturizer you have waiting!		My only beef is that I prefer products do not come in jars due to a higher cross contamination potential but due to the thick paste it probably makes more sense, but then, probably most people do not have skin care spatulas handy like we did so I bet a lot of people are dipping their germy fingers right into the jar. A small plastic scooper added to the box would be a plus."
B0009EILUI,2011,6,5.0,4,4,98,"Wonderful facial scrub, used it for years","I've used this product for years and love it.  I have normal skin but have areas around the mouth that are somewhat prone to acne.  This scrub is wonderful for keeping skin pores unplugged and leaves skin feeling soft.		NOTE:  Many people don't understand how to use the product.  You put a dab of it in the palm of your hand and drop a couple of drops of water on it.  Rub it in the palm of your hand until it thins out a bit, THEN use it on your face.  It's wonderful and I highly recommend it!"
B0009EILUI,2005,5,3.0,20,27,218,"Nutmeg and Clover, Over and Over","This exfoliant is designed to wake up your skin, scrubbing it with tiny abrasive ingredients to get rid of the old and bring forth the new.  It exposes a newer layer of cells, removing dirt and older skin cells.  One's face feels fresher and looks healthier.  Burt's Bees does this and more, and it's the more that I don't like.		In its admirable stance of using natural ingredients, the product contains sweet almond oil and almonds, vegetable glycerine, oats, orange peel and oil, rose powder, pecan powder, grapefruit seed extract, nutmeg powder, clove powder, tocopherol (vitamin E), and fragrance.  It's the nutmeg and clover that I don't like.  The scent is so strong that it feels like you've smeared pumpkin pie on your face.  The scent lingers, even after several rinses.  It's glorious if you love this smell, but it's very annoying if you don't.  Although it's called ""citrus,"" the overloaded spice smell completely dominates; I didn't smell citrus at all.		The other problem is a noticeable oily texture.  The oily feeling does rinse away, but aesthetically it's a letdown, antithetical to the fresh, cleansing feeling one expects.  The product has a not uncomfortable ""grit"" to it, so it's up to the exfoliating task. Still, I'd easily recommend similar products by Origins and Alba over this Thanksgiving potpourri."
B0009EILUI,2006,4,4.0,3,3,108,"works well without being too harsh or drying","I think this scrub is great. It's gentle but seems to exfoliate well. As other reviewers have said you only have to use a small amount, it smells great (something like carrot cake maybe?), and lasts forever. My only complaint is that it leaves your skin feeling slightly oily. At first I was worried about this because I have oily skin and I thought this product might clog my pores or cause a breakout... but I've been using it for a couple of months now & have not had any problems. I think this scrub would work well for people with dry skin too since it is moisturizing."
B0009EILUI,2005,6,5.0,7,9,26,"Great cleanser","I have a lot of problems with sensitive skin.  Most cleansers make me itchy.  I love this product!!  It cleans great with a fresh citrus scent."
B0009EILUI,2012,7,5.0,2,2,341,"Feels wonderful and smells YUMMY!","I've been looking for a new facial scrub, and had a few friends recommend this one. Upon opening the jar, I noticed how thick it was. That doesn't bother me. Just scoop out a small amount, really, about 1/2-1 tsp is plenty, and mix with some warm water. It will produce a slight lather, and is very gritty, but again, neither of which bothers me. I noticed the smell immediately; like pumpkin pie! :) I thought, this HAS to have nutmeg in it. I checked the ingredients list, and yep, nutmeg powder! I have a bit of a pumpkin pie obsession (bordering on unhealthy, seriously), so I  may be slightly biased due to the smell. Don't get me wrong, though. It's not an overly sweet smell. If you have nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice in your cabinet, take a whiff, and that's what this smells like. There may be some citrus-y undertones, but really all I can pick up for sure is the nutmeg. But enough about the smell, that does not a good product make (though it sure helps!). I gave my face a good scrub, and rinsed with warm water. I did rinse more than usual, since it still felt slick, which I don't normally get from other cleansers. This is a vastly different product than I have ever used, though, so I quit rinsing and dried my face, and then it felt fine. Actually, more than fine. It felt so soft and smooth. Most facial scrubs will leave you feeling smooth, but this was the best smooth feeling I have ever had. I didn't get that scrubbed-raw feeling, either, like some products will do. So, to sum up what has been a slightly longer review than intended: Smells so good I might be at risk of eating it. Leaves skin silky soft and smooth with no irritation. And a tip, the 2-pack on Amazon is the same price per jar as it is in my local Target. Wouldn't buy the single on Amazon since it's slightly higher. Enjoy!"

I do LOVE this product though. If you do not have acne and you are looking for a scrub this would be great for you. The smell was really bad at first but then I began to love it. It is difficult to apply at first because it comes out in pieces. When I used it I took some out with my finger and put it in the palm of my hand and then I put pieces on my face and started rubbing it in. This is gentle enough to use daily. It did make the parts of my face that don't have acne smooth.

I rarely break out but I do struggle with dry skin that lacks radiance.  I decided to try this scrub because I love Burt's Bees products and I figured a scrub would liven up my skin.  The first three days or so, I liked it.  It's fun to use and smells nice.  But after a while, I noticed that I had a lot of dirt embedded in my pores.  My pores are normally very tiny and I don't get blackheads.  However, I began sprouting dark spots all over my face, especially near my nose.  Once I quit using this, my skin cleared up again.  Maybe it's not meant for dry skin.  If you do use this, I'd only scrub with it a few times a week and make sure you use another cleanser that has serious deep-cleaning properties, because this citrus scrub doesn't deep clean.  I found a better scrub with that St. Ives stuff, but I guess this is worth a try.  Just don't expect it to deep clean."

It feels comparable to St. Ives, which I have been told actually tears the outer layer of your dermis- not good. Now this is all natural, so it may not have that harsh of effect, but I just don't like it. It's perfect for my husband's face however. He actually gets a good scrub. I will stick with the Aveeno face scrubs as the grit is substantial, but not harsh. Oh and the smell is definitely strong of cloves, not orange."
B0009EILUI,2010,1,2.0,2,4,340,"Did I get a defective jar?!","In my pursuit of using more natural (or green) products in my life, I have changed my wonderful clinique exfoliating scrub (no probs with that product whatsoever, other than it's not natural) to this product as my once a week skin refresher.  To give the reader a bit more background, I have what you would call ""normal"" type skin, but if it went one way or the other, my skin would tend to be more dry than oily.  I don't have any real skin afflictions like acne or breakouts, but I also rarely wear make up.  Thus said, I only use an exfoliator once a week.  I was basically not used to this product.  First, my jar of this citrus facial scrub was so concentrated that it had the consistency of play-doh, so it was hard to get this stuff out of the jar. Also, make sure that you add a little water to the amount you are applying to your face, as it helps applying so much more.  However, when I spread it across my face, it seemed to pill up instead of coat evenly.  And there really isn't much ""scrub"" to this scrub either (try none at all).  When I rinsed this product off my face, it left an oily residue, so much that I wasn't sure if I needed to put on moisturizer after drying.  I can get past the baking cabinet hodge podge of spices smell if this was a good product, but I will definitely be looking for a better natural exfoliator.  This product is just so much different than my clinique or St. Ives apricot scrub, and I did not like it.  I will give it a second star based on the fact that the product's packaging is recyclable (jar is glass, lid is steel, and box is paperboard) and I will give it the ""benefit of the doubt"" star as it is the first ""natural"" exfoliating product that I've tried.  There could possibly be worse out there, but I am dubious of that."

This product was not one of those.  This stuff works.  I don't know if it's because my face was in such horrible condition that just two nights of use and I could tell the difference in the size of my pores, my skin tone was more even, and my face was smoother and not so bumpy looking.  My acne have also cleared up.  I definitely would continue to use this product as long as it's available and continue to do as well as it has."

Before I purchase any skin care product I check it out on Beautypedia.com.  This website has saved me a lot of time, frustration, and money.  This night cream is light, fragrance free, & non-greasy.  It has a fair amount of retinol, green tea, and small amounts of (2) forms of Vitamin E plus it is packaged properly so that the beneficial ingredients are not exposed to the light, air, & bacteria that destroys them.  It is reasonably priced and I agree with Beautypedia's review that it is 'one of the better retinol products to be found at the drugstore'.  It is certainly worth trying.		I am (57) years old and I do NOT expect any lotion or cream to make me look as I did in my 20's; however if I use this cream on a regular basis I absolutely can tell a difference in my skin tone and the overall appearance of my complexion."

It is the only moisturizing agent that I can use on my nose without causing pimples! yay! It's also amazing what it does for skin tone, texture, firmness and wrinkles. I hardly wear makeup anymore on a day to day basis. I am so, so pleased with this product.		My only minor complaint is that it's a little thick and I found it hard to use only a ""pea sized amount"" to cover my whole face and neck. I have found that mixing it with a tiny bit of my Dead Sea Minerals Vitamin C serum/gel allows me to spread the ""pea sized amount"" all over with no problem.		If you start using this product, make sure you use sunscreen all the time during the day. The Retinol makes your skin really sensitive and you can get some nasty burns with very little exposure. Also, be prepared for a few days of red, irritated skin when you first use it. But don't worry, it goes away quickly and the results are fantastic!"

This is affordable and works well overall.  We both don't have overly oily or dry skin so we're able to use a myriad of products with success.  This has retinol in it, so if you're sensitive to that you might want to look elsewhere.  My view on facial products is that you shouldn't expect a miracle or huge change - that's totally unrealistic.  But you should expect something that seems to help a bit with aging and moisture - this one does that for both of us.  We'll likely keep use this one for a while."

I love that it's not greasy, but yet it gives me just the right amount of moisture before bed.

I chose Neutrogena Anti Wrinkle Night Cream because of the good reviews I saw from different online sites. They say it is easier to prevent wrinkles than actually curing them when you get it. I wash my face first before putting the night cream. The directions state to put a pearl size amount. This cream doesn't have a strong odor, just a very very light one and it is not displeasing at all. The feel on myskin is very nice and creamy, not oil at all. My skin soaks up the night cream and my face does not feel oily or slimy at all. In fact my feels rather plumpy and nice. I have used this product for almost two weeks and I have not experienced any rashes, breakouts or red spots. I only gave this four stars because this is my first anti wrinkle cream that I have used. Actually my second. I did buy a Lancome anti-wrinkle eye cream. If I were to compare the two even though the Lancome version is for the eyes only, Neutrogena feels much more creamy and my skin soaks it immediately. The Lancome version is also nice but it feels less creamy. I only use the Lancome for my eyes though. I use a regular moisturizer in the morning (Oil of Olay with SPF) This does not have not any anti-wrinkle benefits but if I were to compare the two, Oil of Olay seems much more oilier and thinner, while as I've mentioned before, Neutrogena feels much more creamy and my skin soaks it up immediately. I definitely recommend Neutrogena Anti Wrinkle Night Cream. I have no complaints at all. I would use their anti-wrinkle day cream also but I think I have to finish up my Oil of Olay stash first.

Unlike the other reviewer, I really like the smell and consider it a plus."

I'm not sure if it made me look any younger (I already get mistaken for highschoolers as it is), but it did help decrease the appearance of a forehead crease I've had since I was 13. I don't think this product is strong enough to REVERSE a lot of age damage, but based on research it seems to be the best on the market for its price-range.  Although the tube looks fairly small, it lasted me a couple of months. I added this to my nightly treatment of stridex."

A little bit of research clearly indicated this acne in my mid-20's was hormonal and excessively hard to treat without dermatologist intervention. However, I did see it mentioned that research indicated that creams with retinoids could help. So I picked this up as something to try before going in for a prescription strength option.		I didn't notice much for the first two weeks - then I developed a really rough patch on my chin for 3-4 days. I pushed through and things went uphill fast from there. My skin looks fresh and smooth every morning. It's helped significantly reduce the appearance of my former acne scars. Best of all, my monthly hormonal acne is a lot better! I still get a couple of manageable spots, but nothing like the big painful cysts.		The cream itself is very light (now in the dead of winter, sometimes it feels a bit too light, but I just use a heavier daytime moisturizer), fragrance free, and one small tube lasts a long time - you only need to apply a pea-sized amount. I wish all my beauty rituals were this easy and inexpensive!"

I don't have many signs of wrinkles yet, but I have battled hormonal acne since my teens.  Although oral minocycline was effective against my acne, it wasn't ideal as a long-term solution.  I have tried lots of different products over the years formulated for fighting acne, including over-the-counter solutions containing benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, as well as ProActiv and Differin gel.  Either they didn't work very well, or they were harsh and dried my skin out.  I also tried Retin-A Micro at one point, which contains a stronger version of the retinol in this product, and it caused terrible dryness and peeling.		This product has been very effective in clearing up my acne in the short term.  I haven't experienced any dryness or peeling at all, and my breakouts are much reduced.  Plus, a bonus is that maybe I'm warding off any impending wrinkles.  For adults who are still experiencing acne problems, I would suggest giving this product a shot.  It's cost effective too, because one tube should last months."

While the regular Elizabeth Arden Prevage is smooth, not unpleasant, and, I think, effective, this particular jar of Prevage MD was quite the opposite.		For starters, it smells. Not just fragranced, but really, some kind of unpleasant odor. Nevertheless, I tried it, figuring that perhaps the &#34;professional&#34; grade formula just smelled different. That wasn't the only thing that was different.		I have combination skin, leaning toward oily most of the year. After maybe two weeks of Prevage MD, my entire face was dry, peeling, and itchy. Worst of all, it was blotchy and puffy. I lathered on the moisturizer, but it wasn't until a week after I stopped using Prevage MD that my skin returned to normal.		Now I use Prevage in the morning, Retin-A at night, and a moisturizer with each. My skin is much, much better. I am sorry I tried to cut corners, but I am also sorry I spent any money on this at all.

Scientifically (I am a scientist by profession) the Retin A 1% should be better, but I have found that Prevage MD makes my skin look even younger- without all the irritation of Retin A. It is even reducing the two teeny lines I was getting around my eyes. My skin looks more luminous, with a youthful glow I haven't seen in years. BUT- make sure you get the real thing from a DR!

My eyes were swollen shut and then my face began to peel. It was horrible! I ended up going to the doctor and had to have a steroid injection to stop the rapid advancement of my allergic reaction.(Which was progressing even as I sat in the doctor's office.) I do not have overly sensitive skin and have never had a reaction to any lotions or other treatments before, but I made up for lost time when I used Prevage MD.

Unfortunately, Botox is too expensive for me and only last 6 months, so my doctor recommended me Prevage MD.  The line between my eye brows has dissapeared.  Prevage MD has helped me get my skin soft as a baby's bottom and it has lighten up dark areas of my face.  I recently, stared using this cream on the dark circles around my eyes.  The product instructions do not read that can be use for around the eye areas but I took my chances.  After putting the Prevage MD on the dark circles, I use a good moisturizer right after and I start noticing the dark circles getting lighter.  I am sticking to this product.  I always keep 2 bottles in my house.		PS: Prevage MD is not the same as Prevage.  Prevage MD is pure.  The regular Prevage from Elizabeth Arden is diluted so it will not deliver the best results.

After reading about the rash outbreaks experienced by many, I tried this product using a VERY small amount applied only to my deepest facial creases.  It was all fine for about 2 weeks (long after the period suggested when doing a patch test).  After that time, I developed a horrible rash on my foot.  It spread to my lower leg, then I got patches of it on my thigh.  The next rashy area developed on my hands, then I had some patches on my face.  The itching is absolutely intense, with small blisters and ""weeping"".  Cortisone ointment helped me stop the itch long enough so I wouldn't scratch in my sleep.  Having it on the foot is agony because the rubbing created by walking causes the rash to itch madly and simultaneously supply a simulated scratching.  This creates a viscious cycle of itching, scratching, further irritation and outbreak, etc.  I am surprised this product managed to find its way on the market when there are so many people adversely affected by it.

B000CONLRI,2011,4,5.0,3,3,195,"Excellent Product!","I have been using Prevage MD for 5 years now. I am almost 60 but no one has ever guessed me to be older than 45.  I credit Prevage MD. I have purchased it through both a doctor's office and Amazon.com. I have never experienced any difference in results. A few years ago Elizabeth Arden/Allergan did change the texture of the product by adding more moisturizing ingredients. That may be what other reviewers have referred to when they found that the product seemed somewhat ""diluted"" which differed from their previous purchases. There have been times when I ran out of Prevage MD and had to wait a month to reorder. During that time I would see a significant change in my skin's smoothness and overall healthy appearance. After reordering and using the product again, the results were visible and greatly improved within a couple days. It has been years since I ordered this product from a doctor. I always order through various vendors on Amazon.com and have never received anything but the real product. I consider Prevage an necessity, not a luxury, and can testify that the product sold through Amazon.com is the real deal."
B000CONLRI,2008,8,5.0,3,3,24,"Great Product","Fabulous product. I have been using Prevage MD for two years and see very good results.  I use it only at nightime.  Wonderful product."
B000CONLRI,2007,5,5.0,3,3,126,"Buy only from a Dr office!!!","Prevage is an amazing product! I am an aesthetician that retails this in a doctors office. It is a very strong product that delivers wondeful results. Products that are purchased where they are not technically supposed to be purchased (ie: Paul Mitchell in Stop n Shop) are usually fake or tampered with. Also, there are problems with irritation from Prevage due to the dyes and fragrances that have been added to hide the horrible scent of the wondefully working ingredient. When purchased in the proper location, you will love your skin after using this product! FYI Visage MD is a claiming to have 1.5% Ibedenone and they are selling it online. Either that is a lie, or they will get in a lot of trouble soon."
B000CONLRI,2012,5,1.0,2,2,192,"BEWARE- Severe Contact Dermatitis to Product","I used Prevage MD for about a month two times a Day. One day My upper and lower eyelids became red and itchy and I thought it was my sunscreen. The doctor confirmed it was a contact dermatitist and prescribed a 10 day steroids pack. However, I didn't stop using the Prevage thinking there was no connection. Seven days later (while still on the meds) I awoke to my entire face and neck area in a red, itchy, bumpy allergic fiasco. I had never seen such a reaction in all my life to any food or product I ever used! The. Doctor gave me a shot of cortisone and then more pills. That was yesterday and my rash is getting better but it was so severe and so shocking to me that it happened.		The literature downplays contact dermatis from this product but I'd like to hear if anyone has has a similar reaction. What ingredient in this product would cause this?		Thanks for listening and any input or ideas you have on this reaction I'd be happy to hear about it to figure out why I had such a severe reaction."
B000CONLRI,2011,3,4.0,2,2,147,"PrevageMD vs. Elizabeth Arden Prevage","I've found the Elizabeth Arden Prevage to work great. No rashes or anything bad. Just really smooth, almost poreless skinn. Beautiful. I switched because it was a tad cheaper buying MD over Elizabeth Arden online. The MD-version seems a bit harsher (maybe stronger). I use it on my face and chest and the PrevageMD makes my chest itch. No bumps or rashes, but it definitely itches.  After two weeks, I finally got a clue and switched back to Elizabeth Arden on my chest and no more itching.  And my face appears to be breaking out more since using PrevageMD. I usually don't have much of a problem with zits, but have started seeing small pimples pop up since I started using PrevageMD.  However, my skin still looks poreless...just with some minor blemishes.  I'm definitely going back to using the Elizabeth Arden-version as soon as I run out."
B000CONLRI,2010,3,3.0,2,2,185,"Not sure it's done much for me but no bad side effects either...","I've been using Prevage MD for a couple years now.  I can't really tell if it's doing much but I figure it's a long term kind of thing (like my skin my be worse if I hadn't been using it...am I just rationalizing?)?  Anyway, I've bought it both at a doctor's office and online -- no difference in product in my experience.  Also I never had any bad reactions like rashes...I think it's possible that people can be sensitive to anything but I had no problem.  Also, it has a really lightly perfumed smell, nothing offensive, so I don't know what other reviewers are talking about unless what they got was spoiled or something.  So, all in all, I've had no negative experience with it but I can't say I woke up one morning with a completely new complexion either.  My derm says it's good stuff (and not because she sells it because she doesn't) and I trust her...she's brilliant and is involved in all kinds of research at Stanford and UCSF medical schools.  We're all looking for quick beauty fixes.  Do they really exist???"
B000CONLRI,2009,5,4.0,2,2,126,"Good Product","I just started using this product about 6 weeks ago. I got it from an MD's office and read all the literature included with the container. I found it to have a really good effect on my dry skin/minor wrinkles and I am middle aged. It has a hydrating effect, and if you get your regular rest and are not run-down or tired, it gives your skin a really nice, firmer texture. It's not a miracle drug; nothing is. I know that to effectively get rid of your wrinkles, you have to have some kind of deep peel, preferably the CO2 laser. I have used other products and like this one - I would definitely use it again. All products have the potential to cause allergies."
B000CONLRI,2009,3,1.0,2,2,80,disappointed,"I had purchased Prevage elsewhere. The product had worked very well. It had lightened some dark spots noticeably and also removed some fine wrinkles. When I started using the Prevage I got from Amazon the dark spots and wrinkles came back after about 3 weeks of using the product. I am not pleased at all with the results I got from the product. It seems to be totally different than the product I bought in the past (not from Amazon)"
B000CONLRI,2010,10,4.0,4,5,280,"Works For Me","My expectations for a skin cream are as follows:	1) Do no harm	2) Provide a positive cost to benefit ratio	3) Show benefits within a reasonable amount of time.....a month or two at most	4) Be pleasant to use. No strange medicinal smells nor oil slick texture	5) Must not attract insects or create skin eruptions		That said, this is pretty good stuff. It goes on easily, and it does help the tone and quality of the skin. I have not had an adverse reaction to it.		An earlier attempt at Retin A was a disaster. My face burned and became red and chapped. My dermatologist's advice was to stick it out. I caved (please refer to #s 1-5 as listed above). I am not a masochist....at least where my skin is involved.		I find much of the Olay Definity and Regenerist lines of products excellent but lately I've realized I needed something more....powerful. There are other options out there but Prevage MD works for me. I use it under my other creams. When I stopped using it my face did not look as smooth or even toned.		The negatives to this product are:	A) Some reviewers have reported reactions to the strength. Test before you try	B) The color is an odd yellow-brown when it comes out of the bottle but it goes on clear	C) The smell is sort of pukey but it doesn't make me actually puke and it doesn't linger long	D) There is only 1 fluid ounce in the bottle....this is not a lot of product		If you know of something better (please refer to #s 1-5 as listed above) please let me know."

B000F63TW0,2011,1,2.0,1,7,123,"Acme and Acme Scars beware","I bought this item due to its high positive review rate and I thought that I had used this product before. Apparently the Olay product I used was not this because I have horrible redness left after each useage which has been twice since buying this and each time it left me with the same result. My skin which was normal before was inflamed afterward and acme which I did not know was there before, suddenly appeared and left the entire area red and horribly noticeable. It also managed to pop open a few of my pimples which where nearly completely gone, leaving them red and irritated. If you have acme or possibly have acme I would not recommend this product to you."

But, I just found out that Olay still tests their products on animals.  I just think that there is no place for animal testing anymore.  Imagine the pain the animals went through when this scrub was applied.  So, I can't use this product, or ANY product from Olay until they change their policies.  Too bad.  Can anyone recommend a good scrub alternative?"
B000F63TW0,2012,5,2.0,2,3,96,"At most a good scrub","At most this is a good scrub. After using it, I feel that my skin is squeaky clean. But it doesn't do anything deeper for the skin at all, as in I still get pimples and my pores are still clogged. Perhaps my skin needs more drastic help. This is simply too mild to be of much good. After a while, it was too much effort for not much result. You have to scrub for about one minute and then apply the second solution. There's also the risk that one will run out before the other."

Here is the deal: I have young-ish (30), somewhat dry skin, I struggle with the occasional acne breakout/blackheads and some melasma. Along with that, I really want to prevent lines and wrinkles, so I wash my face and moisturize with SPF every day: I DO take care of my face.	This kit just added that extra little bit, that I have having a hard time achieving with my regular skin care.	I feel like it boosted my complexion, made my face super-soft and actually cleaned my pores. Hurray!	ONLY drawback: my face felt very dry after use, so I moisturized (duh!) and there was some skin peeling on my forehead."

I started using Olay, and the break outs slowed down and weren't as bad as they used to be.  I've continued using Olay products, so my skin was in fairly good shape.  After I turned 38, I noticed that some of my skin was getting discolored.  I've had some faint lines around the eyes, but that didn't bother me as much as the spots (acne scars, age spots-not sure).  Anyway, I stepped up my plan.  I bought Regenerist MicroDermabrasion as a part of it.  I love it!  Best $20 I've spent on my face in a long time.  The start of crow's feet are gone as are the faint spots.  My skin hasn't looked like this since I was in my 20s.  I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has begun to see some differences in their skin.  I don't know if it would work for people with deeper lines or darker spots, but it definitely worked for me."

It also helps clear up acne breakouts that I seem to occasionally have.  This is a great product and it's great on all skin types.

B000F63TW0,2011,4,4.0,1,1,191,"A Mini Spa Treatment at Home","I just bought this kit a week ago and tried it right away. Step one is like some kind of salt scrub, and do that a minute or two and then add the activator/peel gel. It's a bit warm, and foams a bit (like promised). Rinse it off after a minute or so of activator and you're good to go. I've probably used this three or so times in the last week, trying to sandblast a few scars and uneven spots off my face. It hasn't irritated my skin at all, and afterwards my face looks better and more even. I used it on some old hormonal acne scars that were still a bit raised and irritated, following it with Neosporin and my skin feels hugely improved in those trouble spots in just a week. (Even though I know you shouldn't use it on troubled trouble spots, but oh well, I'm impatient.) The swelling is down and it's a lot smoother and healthier looking.

Even after the first use, I could notice subtle differences in the texture of my skin.  I've been using it for a few weeks now and my pores are noticeably smaller, my skin is smoother (and hydrated but not greasy!).

Then you put on the activator and it desolves the grainy first step and warms your face up a bit.  Then rinse.  I like the Oley brand pretty good.  Compared to the Sephora, the warming sensation does not last as long and I don't feel like I look as fresh faced with this as the Sephora.  But, I feel like it is pretty good and for 1/3 of the cost of the Sephora it is well worth it."

I wasn't expecting the blemish marks to fade right away but they are lighter than 3 weeks ago. I have paired this treatment with a hyaluronic acid / serum to put back some moisture that is lost in the peel process. Also I have just begun using/drinking Meiji's amino collagen powder to revitalize some collagen in my system to help improve skin color and texture. The hyaluronic acid application I started for about 2 weeks. The collagen powder I started for about 2 days. I'll give the whole combination another 2 weeks to truly see how it performs. Overall the Olay peel works well and would recommend."

I bought this and tried it and after just using it once, my skin feels like it did when I was in my twenties. I think with regular use, it will help keep my skin a little more youthful. Its not a miracle and I don't want to exaggerate but I think you can only get improvement from using this.  If you have extra sensitive skin, it may cause it to be too red. I felt very pampered using this.  Ive never had a professional facial, or been to a spa, so for me, this was special. And those tiny, fine laugh lines are almost invisible.

B000F63TW0,2010,2,5.0,10,11,113,Ouch!,"Having tired of seeing an esthetician and dermatologist and spending oodles of money with little or no results, I finally decided to try the Olay Regenerist system.  Although it was pretty 'harsh' the first time I used it, I can truly say that once I established a routine I saw results.		Go slow at first and listen to your skin.  If you feel pain -- STOP. If you want to try again later, do so. However, I cannot use this 2x per week like the directions say you can. It burns too much. Right now I am on the every other week schedule.		Great alternative to spending time and money without any efforts."
B000F63TW0,2010,10,5.0,7,7,318,"Wonderful - 15x Facials for Half the Price of One!","As someone who is always on the look-out for new facial products, I have to say this particular peel kit is a good step above the rest. At a measly 20$ - this product does the full work of a standard facial, and there are a number of benefits that come along with it.		First off the average facial runs anywhere from 40$ to 85$ in my experience, with the higher-end facials running on an hour at some of the more luxurious spas. If you don't mind skipping the cucumber slices and some steam, the Olay Microdermabrasion kit does at >least&lt; the work of a standard 40$ treatment. Multiply the number of times you can actually use this product if you're careful and that could be saving you a ballpark figure of around 580$! (40 x 15 - 20). It doesn't take a math major to know that's a huge amount of savings. Secondly, the scent of this product is absolutely divine - no, really, I wish I could wear it as perfume! When I'm done using this product, my husband tells me I smell delicious (enough said). But more importantly, yes, yes, this product absolutely works - and after using it sparingly (4x a month) for about three months now, my skin feels and looks better than ever with enough in the bottle left over for another two treatments or maybe even three.		Bottom line is you will not find something more affordable and reliable than this peeling kit. Even if it's not what you're looking for I would still recommend it, because the noticeable results and the cost offset anything wrong with it (and I have yet to have a single problem). Amazon ships it, so you know it will arrive prompt (got mine in a day with 2-day free shipping) and intact. Really, as far as I'm concerned, this kit really nailed it - Approved!"
B000F63TW0,2010,0,5.0,7,7,291,"Gets rid of flaky skin","I've only used this for three weeks now, but I can already tell a huge difference in the clarity and brightness of my skin.  I almost didn't buy it since I usually go by Paula Begoun's reviews of products, and she basically said that this product is no more than baking soda.  Well, baking soda or not, it really works to get rid of dead, flaky skin, and I will definitely re-purchase this as long as Olay continues to make it.		I bought this product since I've used Retin-A once or twice a week (depending on the time of year) for the last two years, and the Retin-A causes extreme dry patches and flakiness on my face.  During this time, I've tried both cheaper exfoliants (from Avon and several from Boots) and also higher-end ones (from Elemis and Ren), but nothing helped remove the flaky patches and smooth out my skin -- until I used this Olay product.  It leaves your skin so soft and bright, and removed all of the dry and flaky areas.  In fact, I may even be brave enough to try mineral makeup, something I've always shied away from since it makes my dry patches look even worse!		As far as wrinkle reduction, it could be the placebo effect, but my forehead wrinkles and crows' feet really do seem to be less deep since I've started using this.		Before buying this, I had read a lot of reviews, both on this site and others, and many people said that it is similar to Philosophy's more expensive product.  The orange smell is a bit strong, but, since you're only using it for a few minutes, it's nothing too terrible.		Overall, I'm so glad that I bought this product!"
B000F63TW0,2008,2,5.0,7,7,74,"The Best Ever","I rarely write reviews ... unless the product is awful or wonderful.  This product is amazing.  I have tried more products to try to improve the condition of my skin ... this is the real deal.  I have used it five times and my skin continues to improve ... does away with age spots and my skin is now so smooth.  I would recommend this product to anybody ... any age.  Absolutely the best."
B000F63TW0,2009,2,3.0,12,14,233,disappointing.,"First let me say I have been using a gentle cleanser, a scrub, a facial, and a lotion with spf 15.  I recently added an anti-wrinkle night cream. My face is soft, smooth, my blackheads are almost all gone, my pores are smaller, and my coloring is less blotchy.  My wrinkles, however, are still the same.		So I thought I needed to try something stronger.  I found this product, I read all the reviews, including the one that warned this product could be too strong.  I bought, applied, scrupulously following the directions, and came out with a clean face.  No smoother than after using my regular scrub, and less convienient because it's a 2 step process, instead of an all in one.  No change in the appearance of my wrinkles.  No redness, blotchiness, or oilyness.  Just a clean face.		I'm going to continue to use this, just in case there is a cumulative effect, in which case I will come back and update.  For right now, I can only imagine that those who had a dramatic effect, positive or negative, had not been following a regular skincare regimen.		EDIT, Mar. 29.  I've used the product about 5 times now.  It exfoliates and leaves your face feeling smoother.  I guess from the name and the price, I expected more.  I will use it until it's gone, but I won't buy it again.  END EDIT"
B000F63TW0,2010,2,5.0,9,10,39,"LOVE THIS!!!","I WOULD DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT...IT WORKS!

B000F63TW0,2011,9,5.0,6,6,245,"Olay Regenerist MicroDermabrasion - WOW!","The scent of the scrub was very pleasant, sort of an orange/citrus scent. The package says to use a quarter-size amount, but I just used the bit that was on the seal, and that was more than enough. The crystals are very rough, but I got used to the harshness fairly quickly. Interestingly, I kept waiting for the gel suspension to dry out (thus causing a mess when all the crystals fell off my face), but it never happened!		The next step is to add the serum to your fingertips and then apply it over the crystals on your face. The serum is meant to dissolve the crystals and... do something. My fingertip immediately sizzled, and when I applied the serum to my face... whoa! Talk about a heat flash! It only lasted a second or two, but it was very hot!		Rinsing my face took forever as the crystals just didn't want to wash away. I used the lotion that came with the Pro-X Protocol... bad decision. I would suggest forgoing moisturizer or trying to find something that is very, very gentle; otherwise, your face will feel as if it is melting off.		Overall, I am satisfied with the product. My skin feels very soft, and unless I am imagining it, my skin tone seems to be more even already. The package says you can use the product up to twice a week, but I think I will stick with once every 7-10 days."

I love how soft and supple my skin looks after using it!		Be careful not to over-scrub as was my tendency the first time I used it.  Be gentle until you get a good feel for the product.  I prefer to use it before bedtime because, like plucking my eyebrows, my skin can get a little red and irritated immediately after.		I highly recommend you give this stuff a try!"
B000F63TW0,2009,9,5.0,6,6,110,"Love this item!","I have been using this product for a very long time. Even though I am 51, people think I am in my 30's for some reason. Not sure if that is related to this product or because I was blessed with oily skin which helps a lot.  I can not find any product to compare this too because there is nothing like it on the market.  I use to use Apricot Scrub until they changed the formula. That's when I gave this a try and I'm hooked for life. I do wish the price would come down as it is over the top a bit.	Try it........you'll love it too!"
B000F63TW0,2007,1,1.0,192,277,456,"An esthetician's word  of caution","As an esthetician I would advise against using these sort of products. They basically sand your face off. Please leave microderm and abrasive exfoliation to trained and licensed professionals. I can assure you that I am not just saying this to drum up business.		I would much rather have people not do anything to their skin than to use a product like this. You initially see great results because of the aggressiveness of the exfoliation, but believe me, you will pay for it in the long run. The main ingredient in this product is aluminum oxide (also referred to as corundum), which is characteristically known for its hardness, and is typically used as an industrial abrasive in sandpaper and as a component in cutting tools. This material is rated as 9 out of 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, making it second only to diamonds in abrasiveness. You may argue that this is also the same substance use in clinical microdermabrasion procedures, but you need to realize that these procedures can only be preformed by a board certified plastic surgeon, dermatologist, or licensed esthetician trained in microdermabrasion treatment. I see people coming in every day who use these at home kits and products, and they all have the same issue; It worked great at first, then after some time they started to notice that it wasn't working as effectively, so they used it more often and harder.		Exfoliation of the skin increases cell turnover and helps prepare the skin for hydration and moisturization when done right. When this process is done more often than necessary, or in an overly aggressive manner, you can end up damaging your skin and causing permanent scar tissue build up and inflammation. People don't seem to realize that there is oil on our face for a reason, it's there to protect and moisturize our skin. When you constantly cleanse and exfoliate your skin, you are doing more harm than good. Over stripping the skin causes irritation, break-outs, and heightened sensitivity that rarely can be reversed. When your skin is constantly bombarded by aggressive exfoliation, it's defense is to build up thicker layers of skin for protection. So please, if you do use this, use extreme caution, don't use it on your face, and do not use it more than once a week, if that.		Ask any esthetician, plastic surgeon, or dermatologist out there and they'll tell you the same thing: there is a reason people don't get facials, chemical peels, and microderm every day, or even more once a month. The adage ""too much of a good thing"" stands true here.		if you need more convincing, please refer to the following links and make the decision your self.		[...]"

B000F63TW0,2012,7,5.0,2,2,688,"2 Minutes to AH-MAY-ZING!!","I bought this on Amazon about 8 months ago because it was on sale and/or had a coupon that made it worth a try. I think I paid about $15 with free shipping because we are PRIME members. I'm very careful about what I use on my skin and very skepticle about claims a lot of products make. I can't use just any make-up, cleansers or moisturizers on my face because I tend to break out or turn red from them. I use Estee Lauder make up & some of their moisturizers but I also have found that I can use a lot of the OLAY products as well without any adverse reactions. This being the case I decided to give this a go. I got it and of course, like most people, rushed right to the bathroom to use it. At first I barely put any on my face for fear that it was too rough. It IS very gritty but it felt really good. When I smoothed on the serum it was warm and my skin went from feeling tight to relaxed. I rinsed and thought ""okay, this is good"". I'd say it didn't blow my socks off or anything the first time I used it. Since then I've probably used it about once every two months or so. I DO NOT use it as an every day treatment nor do I even use it weekly or monthly!!(Here's where the AH MAY ZING comes in) I had probably gone at least two months, it was April or May of this year. I had been outside a lot, working in the garden, mowing on the tractor, getting a lot of sun, sweating a lot of sweat kind of stuff. Even wearing a hat I noticed my skin had more dryness than usual (I AM getting old! I turned 44 in December). Whether it was the sun, weather or just my age showing I didn't like the way my skin was feeling to the touch. I kept thinking I needed a face scrubbing pad with some coarseness to it to grind off this layer of rough, but then I thought ""Hmmm, wonder if that would help"" while looking at my little kit. So I smeared on the grit, gave it a good scrub for at least a minute (I probably go a little longer), then smeared on the serum, humming a little tune because it feels so good, jumped into the shower and washed it off. VOILA! My face was smooth again! That was a couple of months ago and my face got that roughness once again so I used it again tonight. I was so pleased (once again) at how it made this little country gal feel so pampered and ladylike again that I thought I'd like to share my story so others can feel this good too. I'm not saying it's going to be wonderful for everyone, I did look at the 1 star reviews and was surprised at some of the comments. With my skin being sensitive to everything including the sun I was sure if anyone had issues with it, it would have been me, but NO! BTW I am very pale skinned, burn easily (not a redhead though) and have extra sensitive skin because of chemotherapy treatments. I failed to mention that this is one of the reasons I'm unable to use just any kind of product. I'm just saying, if you can afford $15 (I see they have a $5 coupon right now that would make it about that), it's certainly worth a try. I've had many facials in my life and this comes as close as I've ever felt to having a facial and doing it myself at home. Good luck and I hope you love it as much as I do!		One more note... Even using it about 5 times now, I still have more than 1/2 of each containers full of product. I'm guessing for my $15 I'm going to get about 10 scrubbings out of this kit using a generous amount each time, and I'm good with that!!!!"

Oh yes its a great value! , as you get lots of uses out of it. I use it two times per week on my way into the shower.

B000F63TW0,2012,4,1.0,2,2,119,"di not like this product","I bought the kit yesterday and went right home to try it. It has two steps to it.  Step one is the actual micro dermabrasion and step two is a foaming process to activate step one even more.  The actual microdermabrasion granules are much too abrasive for my sensitive skin. Step two did nothing -- no foam, no activation,  nothing. I called the company and they agreed that something was not right.  I returned it to the drug store I got it form for a refund. I guess this type of kit works for a lot of folks (form reading the reviews),  but if you have sensitive skin you may want to try something more on the gentle side."
B000F63TW0,2012,4,5.0,2,2,374,"Really Works - wow - adult acne sufferers this is a great product","I am 36, fair skinned, some acne issues with scarring, and a few ""bumps"" on my nose that are like tiny colorless pimples but never go away.	My skin type is oily, I have big pores but also some wrinkles and expression lines on my forehead. I normally do not like the way I look without makeup.		I purchased the Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion and Peel kit about three weeks ago. It arrived quickly (thank you Amazon)	I tried it out the first day it arrived - the first use I did on my face only, down the neck a little. I was happy with the result, my skin looked somehow ""fresher"" then I got an idea...		I alternated this product three days later with 20% salicyclic acid gel peel (cellbone brand that I got here at Amazon) that I did three days post-dermabrasion, the dermabrasion helped the peel work better.		(DO NOT use dermabrasion on the same day as a peel, or you will burn your face off!!!!)		I have done this microdermabrasion/peel combination four times now in three weeks and the results are nothing less than AMAZING.	Full disclosure: I also started taking 4,000mg of Pantothenic Acid plus 1500mg of liquid L-Carnitine and 250 mg of Zinc for Acne in combination with this new regimen.	All I can say is - it is working - my skin has never looked clearer or better. I can go outside the house without makeup on (but using SUNSCREEN FOR SURE) and I feel confident!		My skin IS smoother, the pores are shrinking, the acne is getting BETTER and is almost GONE. I have had it for years and it is literally almost GONE.	Best of all, the weird bumps on my nose are also almost GONE. Its a miracle.		If you have acne prone skin, make sure you do this microdermabrasion at night, and then follow it up with a very thin layer of benzyl peroxide gel (mild strength) on the acne prone areas before moisturizing. I use the Olay regenerist serum for face and under eyes.		I am happy with the product and WILL DEFINITELY buy it again. I am now using this to help smooth out the skin on my upper arms.

Regenerist makes another mini peel that is single process, but I really don't like the smell (although it also does a good job.)"

B000F63TW0,2011,5,5.0,1,2,157,"Love This","I've always had problem skin, and even in my mid-20's I still feel like i'm a teenager. I get blemishes, have some uneven skin tone, and my face just seems dull. I would wash, tone, use a vitamin lotion, and moisturize, and my skin still wasn't where I wanted it to be. So I finally started looking into facial peel type kits, and I'm so happy I bought this one. I used it twice a week to start, and man what a difference even the first time made! I couldn't stop touching my face! It was crazy soft and looked brighter already. After a few more times my blemishes diminished and my skin just looked so much better. I have since fallen behind in using it (once every other week or so) and I can definitely tell the difference. I would absolutely recommend this product but would say to at least use it weekly to get results."
B000F63TW0,2011,2,3.0,1,2,111,"No noticeable dermabrasive results","I actually ended up buying this in Walmart. It was only $23 so I thought 'what the hey!'. I have used it faithfully and as instructed twice a week for the last 4 weeks so I feel I've given it a fair go. Immediately after using it, it makes my skin feel softer, but it has made no noticeable difference to the texture and uneven-ness of my skin. I now intend to try a full-on microdermabrasion experience. I will keep using the olay twice a week until it's finished. There's no point in wasting it, and like I said it makes my skin feel softer and that's not a bad thing."
B000F63TW0,2011,1,5.0,1,2,102,"Fantastic product!","This is well worth the $20 cost. It is really easy to use, takes 2 minutes for the entire process and your skin will feel extremely soft and smooth- better than a spa facial.  I've used it 3 times so far and there seems to be enough product for at least 3-4 more treatments.  I'm not sure why they have included ""peel"" in the name because I haven't experienced any peeling or flaking, however if you do have rough or chapped skin (or it's flaking from using retinol products) this completely removes all the dead skin and makes your face feel great."
B000F63TW0,2010,6,4.0,1,2,91,"Does a great job!","It really works. Did it last night and I could feel the results immediately after. Leaves skin soft and supple, as well as smooth and bump free. Will definitely be doing it again, at least once a week.I don't see much difference with actual wrinkles and freckles, but then again I don't think its strong enough to actually erase wrinkles or blotches like a real microdermabrasion treatment would (in office, i.e, with a doctor). I definitely recommend it for people wanting smooth skin and to get rid of roughness and bumps."
B000F63TW0,2007,6,3.0,17,28,191,"Don't use this if you have large pores!","DO NOT USE THIS! if you have large pores. I gave 3 stars because it might work for some people and cure their problem, so I can't say it's awful. The first time I used it my face was so oily, made my pores the size of craters and woke up the next day with an Exxon oil slick on my face. So I decided to give it a few more tries, I believe in giving things a couple weeks to see results, and it did the same thing. Anyway, I emailed Oil of Olay and they were very happy to send me a coupon for anything else in their line of products, seeing as I paid over $30.00 for it. I gave the microderm stuff to my best friend that has dryer skin, no acne ever and pretty much has a perfect face. Well she liked it. I beleive stuff made by Oil of Olay is for the elderly or people who don't have real problems with their skin, like acne and such. I guess if you have oily skin don't buy stuff with ""Oil"" as the brand name :)"

Then I had to literally run to the register and pay before I changed my mind.  I'm glad I did.		I didn't know what to expect, since I've never used a microdermabrasion product before.  I have no regrets.  This seemed to lift a veil of dullness from my face, even as I was massaging in the tiny crystals, which are the first half of the treatment.  Both elements of the treatment smell divine.  I recommend this product to anyone who is on a tight budget, or dosen't have time to skip off to a dermatologists office over their lunch break (like the beauty magazines nonchalantly suggest) for a professional chemical peel.		The missing star is due to the high price.  I think that there are similar products on the market available for 7-10 dollars less, though I can't vouch for their effectiveness.  All in all, however, a nice product I will purchase again without buyers remorse!"

I immediately tore open the box and read the instructions then went to work.		5 minutes later, someone else's face was looking in the mirror.		I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT believe how fabulous my skin feels and looks.  It's like silk.  After only one use.  I am floored.

The first time you use it, you will be surprised at how much better you look afterwards, but the coolest part is, if you keep using it twice a week, you will notice all old scars or uneven spots gone, no more flaky skin, and a total glow. Before, I always used St Ives apricot scrub-let me tell you...NIGHT AND DAY DIFFERENCE. After using this, you will not use anything else-oh, and the yummy smell is awesome!"
B000F63TW0,2006,5,4.0,39,47,178,"Nice product but not really microdermabrasion","To call this product microdermabrasion is misleading. It's more like a nice scrub/exfoliant. Compared to professional dermatological microdermabrasion, this product is very mild/light.		That said, it seems like a good product that will yield many applications out of the bottles. I like that you apply it with your fingertips and don't need some kind of battery powered applicator like other home kits, which can be a bit dangerous to use.		Although the granules are very fine and probably quite safe, you probably still don't want to rub them into your skin that hard nor very often. Doing so may cause permanent damage to your skin (redness, etc). Sure, you want to exfoliate, but you do not want to do any damage so please use it gently.		I think this product does a good job of exoliating your skin and  can be considered a good product for that. But it should in no way be compared to professional level microdermabrasion which you get done in a dermatologist's office; the effects of that will be much more noticeable and pronounced."
B000F63TW0,2008,0,5.0,18,20,155,"Really works!","I am almost 40 & I have used facial scrubs for years. I would use them weekly and I always saw and felt an improvement on my face. I found this product on Ebay and decided to try it. It is sooo much better than a regular scrub. I have always had awful white heads around my chin and when you put your makeup on it tends to look icky... The first time my face did feel a little burning but only the first time that I used it. Now I use it 1-2 times a week and my makeup goes on so smooth. I just don't use it when I have a fresh zit, like today : (		I have acne prone skin and it doesn't make me breakout anymore or less with this product. I live in a dry climate and use Olay Total effects after treatment and my skin feels just fine."
B000F63TW0,2011,9,5.0,11,11,253,"The BEST facial care product I have EVER used.","I can't really rave enough about this product.  Why has it taken beauty manufacturers decades to put out a simply home use exfoliation product that really works???  We have scrubs that partially do the job, but there hasn't been a product that will let you do a professional job at home available.		Until now.		The kit comes in two parts, one part a container with what looks like orange liquid sand, the other part a squeeze bottle with a very thick clear liquid.  You simply scoop a little of the orange sand onto your fingers and rub it into your face WHILE DRY.  Your face feels like it is 5-10 degrees hotter while you are applying the substance and then it goes away.  After rubbing that into your face for a couple minutes, you then squeeze out enough of the thick clear liquid from the bottle to cover all the parts of your skin that you massaged earlier.  It starts to foam up a little when the liquid meets the sand, and then I use the Pro-X machine to massage the whole mess into my face for a minute before I rinse.		You will get about 12-20 uses out of each kit, depending on how much you use each time.		I will guarantee to anyone that tries this out that if they take a picture of their face immediately before using it, and then immediately after your face is dry afterwards, you will notice a SIGNIFIGANT difference.  A difference well worth Amazon's $20."
B000F63TW0,2011,6,5.0,10,10,221,"Closest to a miracle product I have ever come","I purchased this as part of an ongoing effort to fade acne scars, but it turned out to be worth so much more.  I was so focused on fixing the scars that I barely noticed that years of stress and acne (treated with RetinA) had left my skin flaky, dull, greasy, and generally lifeless.  In just a couple of minutes this treatment worked wonders to change this.  Scars are less noticeable, but even more wonderful is the radiance that instantly appears in my face.  Flakiness from acne treatments disappears and is replaced by a glowing natural blush in my cheeks.  I was surprised to see that even my usual summer oiliness is hugely improved.  I experienced little to no irritation even those times when I had blemishes actively healing on my face (although I probably wouldn't recommend it for those whose acne is still severe).		 I had used <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GJND8O"">HQ+ Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)</a> for scars for months with moderate satisfaction, but had taken for granted that increased flakiness, irritation, and caustic chemical smell were a necessary part of the process.  Now I can expect so much more.  The product says to use twice a week, so now I can't wait for each Wednesday and Saturday.  Even those with no obvious complaints about their skin should not miss trying this product."

My skin always goes through hell during the winter months when its continually exposed to artificial heat.  My skin feels & looks like I've lost about 7 years time.  I'm very, very pleased with Olay.  I've used their Total Effects lotion for years & I did purchase the regenerist serum to apply after using the kit.  This is an excellent exfoliant & hands down, the best skin regenerating product I've ever used."

I follow what Rebecca Johnson had recommended: You moisten the face and slightly moisten the microderm crystals before applying to the face. But, I add another twist: I use Neutrogena's microdermabrasion battery operated applicator (has a vibrating head). After this, I put on the Olay peel.		For my face, I find it best to use the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion kit. I apply the crystals and then use the Clarisonic Pro to ""grind"" it into my face.

Ives apricot scrub & it does not even compare to this! This micro scrub leaves my skin feelin fresh & new!  It feels like it can breathe if that makes sense.

Then I use my favorite moisturizer, MAC complete comfort creme. It hydrates my skin perfectly.  I get a lot of these ""bumps"" on my face, not acne but flesh colored bumps, and this product makes my face feel so smooth and no more dry flaky skin either! I cant say enough about it.

But I tried it for the first time last night and surprisingly, this morning it looks great! It brought any blackheads I had to the surface and they popped right out.		Its no miracle cure, you're not going to use it once and have totally even skin, this flawless complexion. But if your makeup is going on unevenly, or you have patches of dry skin, or want to eliminate blackheads, I would definitely recommend this.		I have read that people think this is pricey. I disagree. For $20ish, its a great buy. Wait til its on sale, and keep your eye out for coupons. I imagine that if you use this sparingly (and properly) this will last at least 5 uses.		You can spend your time buying lots of $5 face washes,lotions, etc. or you can just save your $$ and buy this once and be done with it."

I have been using the product for about 1.5 months now and I love it! It has made my skin SO smooth (VERY noticeable after the 1st use!), it has never been this smooth before in my life!! The bumps/unevenness has been disappearing w/ continual use and my makeup looks flawless on my skin now. My old acne scars have been fading and I get fewer pimples. Also, my complexion seems brighter after I use this product, probably b/c it's taking away the dead skin cells. To sum up: I loveee the product and would recommend!!!	Some words of caution though: the directions say to use no more than twice a week on non-continuous days... LISTEN TO THAT!! I used it 2 days in a row once and my skin felt blahhh - it was wayyy too much exfoliation, causing lots of moisture loss in my skin and making it really sensitive. Once a week is perfectly fine as well, but I do 2x now, usually on Sun. and Thurs.	Be sure to moisturize afterwards :]!!"
B000F63TW0,2010,5,5.0,3,3,165,WOW!,"I read many reviews before finally purchasing this product because I had my doubts. I'm only 21 but have several brown and red spots on my face and needed to find something that was affordable and would get rid of them. THIS WORKS! I know tons of reviews say the same thing but it's true! I've only used it once and I already notice the spots fading. I didn't think this was possible without a few trips to the dermatologist and spending some major $$. I saw that some people wrote that the crystals were too abrasive.. I have sensitive skin and it did not irritate it at all. So for those reviewers who didn't have the same experience, I'm not sure why it didn't work out for you. Thanks OLAY for making a cheap (price wise), great quality product that's made my skin the way it's supposed to look for my age. I definitely will hang on to this for a long time! :)"
B000F63TW0,2010,3,4.0,3,3,138,Pleased,"I bought this product based on the number of positive review and decent price.  I was pretty impressed with the product overall.  The instructions are simply.  Rub crystals all over your face like a mask and then add serum over the crystals.  You massage the product into your skin for about a minute and rinse off.  When rubbing the crystals into my face, I could tell my face was going to come out super soft.  Massage gently as the crystals are kind of scratchy, but needed to get ultra soft, smooth skin.  My face was a little red for a few hours after use, but you should expect this when you do a major exfolitae like this.  I recommend you do before bed, so the red skin was bother you during the day.  I will definitely get again."

B000F63TW0,2007,4,5.0,5,6,130,"Really excellent results.","This is my favorite of the mini-peel kits. It's easy to use, strong enough to make a difference but not so strong that it hurts your skin. It's two pieces - a medium-textured scrub and an activating solution that finishes the peel. There's no pre-mixing. Just massage the scrub onto your face for a couple of minutes, then add the liquid peel activator. It foams a bit and you can really feel it working. You'll have glowing soft skin immediately and smoother skin with a more even skin tone after a couple of weeks.

B000F63TW0,2011,11,1.0,17,55,63,"I'd love to endorse this but...","I was excited to try this kit out, then I remembered why I don't have any Olay products.  Their products are still tested on animals.  Many other companies shun this practice and I have to support them instead.  You suck, Olay.  Stop testing on animals so that I can buy your crap and not feel twice as guilty about where my money's going."
B000F63TW0,2009,8,4.0,1,1,72,"Not too bad","I'm using this now once a week.  It removes dead skin and helps smooth at the same time.  The crystals are orange and they actually smell pretty good.  The clear solution warms your skin as you rub it over the crystals.  It's not going to give you back 10 years but it does help you look and feel a little younger.  My skin is clear, smooth, and brighter since using this product."
B000F63TW0,2009,7,3.0,1,1,58,"It's alright.","I have an acne problem and have used Erythromycin for way too long. It has damaged my skin. It's very unbalanced. I switch between skin cleansers to keep it under control. This microdermabrasion does help smooth out the blackheads, but it irritates my skin a bit. It's an ok product. I'll prbably try something different next time though."
B000F63TW0,2009,7,5.0,1,1,62,"Amazing results in a flash!!!","I was skeptical at first because quick results are usually too good to be true. But I was shocked and amazed at how much clearer, smoother and softer my skin was after using this the very first time!!!! I highly recommend this product for a cost efficient, quick and private way to improve your appearance. My husband even said I was glowing!!!!!"
B000F63TW0,2009,4,5.0,1,1,82,"Good Kit, Good Price","I purchased this kit for about $16 dollars.  At first, I was skeptical, but I have definitely noticed a difference in the texture of my skin in after two applications. It completely ""loosens"" and removes the dead skin. After using retin-A for several months, my skin was flaky.  I discontinued use a couple of weeks ago in prep to use the olay kit and am really pleased with results.  I'll definitely buy again and save my ""facial"" money for something  more practical."

I have purchased the Kate Somerville line of exfoliating treatment when compared to the Olay Regenerist, I prefer the Olay. However, everyones skin is different. Olay Regenerist works for me!

B000F63TW0,2012,4,1.0,5,7,231,"Not for people with ACNE","I decided to try this product because of the rave reviews, and because the product claims to improve skin tone. I have dark spots and discoloration left from years of suffering from acne on my face. Anyway I have not suffered any active acne flare ups for a while until I started using this product.		I used this product for a week-that's two applications, applied exactly as the directions stated to apply and after the first application I could feel large cyst forming under my skin, but I decided to ignore it and use the product again, -big mistake- I know have a few large cyst present and small whiteheads on my face. Believe me when I say it has been a good while since I have had a flare up like this.		Anyway I am discarding this product.	This is not for people with acne.	In addition I did not see any improvement in the texture of my skin. I have had really soft supple skin from just using a 4.00 dollar bottle of apricot scrub and I think this stuff is too expense for what it claims to do which is nothing but cause acne flare ups.		Now I am back to my routine of using benzoyl peroxide to terminate these large acne cyst on my face, which is no trouble because benzoyl peroxide always works for me immediately."
B000F63TW0,2011,2,2.0,4,6,46,"Not that impressed","I had high hopes after reading the reviews.  I didn't notice a difference in my skin at all.  I have very oily skin so maybe that's why.  It's not a miracle in a jar. Do not let the positive reviews fool you.  This isn't that great."
B000F63TW0,2010,9,4.0,4,6,76,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT...WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND!","Love this product!...I've been using this product on my face for about 2 weeks now and I've noticed a HUGE differenct in the appearance and texture of my skin. My skin is sooo smooth, even after the first time I noticed a big difference. I'm 27 years old and I have acne scars from my teen years and they have lightened significantly since using this system.  Definately worth the $25 I spent at the drug store."

I have been using it for about 2 months and I can definitely see and feel the difference. I have less acne, fading acne scars and less fine wrinkles.

B000F63TW0,2012,6,5.0,1,1,71,"Best ever!","This product is amazing! I purchased it based on positive reviews from other clients many of whom expressed the frustration I experienced with expensive prescription products over a number of years. After using it only 4 times, the bumps on my face have been reduced so much that I cancelled my appointment with yet another dermatologist. Also, this product arrived in perfect condition in only a few days thanks to Amazon."
B000F63TW0,2012,5,5.0,1,1,265,"GREAT PRODUCT but BAD IF...","OMG, the product is amazing. I use it today for the first time and I can already see a noticeable difference -- cleaner, lighter (as if 100% of dirt removed from my face). Based from this result, I can say that the product is strong (has a strong ingredients) to make my skin appear like that for the first time.  Thus, I advise you not to put too much of these in your face cause it will irritate your skin if you are not used to it. In my case, it gave me a little bit of tingly, itchy, a burning-like sensation cause I overdid it. I forgot that this is not a lotion and the skin of the face is thinner and more sensitive than the other part of your body thus a little is what it needs. After applying the crystals, rub and massage your face for 1 minute and apply the serum and continue to rub it for another 1 min. No need to overdo as it is really strong. Follow directions so not to end up having a fried skin. Your goal is to beautify yourself, so dont make it a hellish experience by not applying the right amount and not following directions. Don't overdo.  I have a dry, sensitive skin but unlike other negative comments from other reviewers who had skin break-up after application, I can say this product if used properly, cautiously will do a great effect and difference on your skin. I plan to do it twice a week as directed. But overall, it is a great product!"

I used it last night and when I came into work today, and the first thing my boss said was ,""wow, your face looks so clear today!."" And his friend told him I look extra pretty today. My boss has made a few comments before, pointing out the unevenness of my skin and large pores LOL. So for him to give me a compliment on my skin was a big deal. My make-up goes on much smoother and my pores are much clearer. And the flaky patch of skin above my eyebrow is almost completely gone now :). Like I said though, I've only used it twice so far...hopefully the results  stay"

B000F63TW0,2012,2,5.0,1,1,199,"Great Product for the Price!","I ordered Olay Regenerist because I wanted something that would give my face a deep clean without leaving me bright red for three days.  After reading other reviews, I decided to give it a try.  My only questions is: Why wouldn't you use this product?  I have been using the product for about three weeks (two times a week). It leaves my face soft with little or no redness (after the first use).  My pores appear smaller and it is the first ""scrubby"" product that actually seems to deep clean dirt from my pores.  I have had no break-outs due to this product, and have noticed a lot less shine on my face at the end of the day. The smoothing of my skin has made make-up (although I do not wear a lot) look very natural.		This product does not give the same results as a professional dermabrasion. I have gone that route and my face stays red and blotchy for days after, but no redness with the Olay product. Plus, a professional treatment is just more than I can afford on a regular basis. Olay Regenerist is a very affordable product that does exactly what it claims."

Keep it mind, I'm 30 years old, no visible wrinkles or fine lines.  Just large pores, clogged pores, bumps and blemishes from leftover acne.  I just use it once a week and I don't scrub the crystals on too hard.		Pros:  it's an inexpensive at-home treatment, and it leaves skin really soft and smooth.	Cons:  I haven't seen a change in fine lines or wrinkles since I have none to begin with, plus I only use it once a week with gentle exfoliation."

I try not to scrub too hard, I don't want my face to fall off, but I can definitely feel the product working to slough off any dead skin. After wards, my skin feels so fresh and dewy; my moisturizer just melts in. I use this once a week in conjunction with the regenerist SPF moisturizer during the day, the purple night cream, the eye serum & the total effects anti blemish cleanser (I use my Clarisonic Mia twice daily with the cleanser- LOOOVE THE CLARISONIC!!!).

Afterwards, I put on my expensive night/treatment creams (try crem de la mer and chanel sublime or ReVive) and in the morning I look 28 again. I am 44. Philosophy makes a peel/dermabrasion kit but it is $60+. Glad I found Olay. Saves me a bundle and is essentially the same product. It gives your skin that super smooth evenness that you had in younger days. Do this and use Smashbox BB cream in light and you will have that Cate Blanchett peaches and cream thing happening!"

B000F63TW0,2009,4,4.0,6,6,285,"Very polished results for affordable price!","I read several positive reviews on the OLAY Regenerist Microdermabrasion & Peel Kit and they proved to be right!  I have sensitive skin and have tried several similar products as well as products only sold under a physician's guidance and this is by far the most effective and affordable product in it's price range, in my opinion.	Pros:	*It's very quick and easy to use.  1) Apply about a quarter size of the Derma-Crystals to your face & massage in for about a minute.  2) Apply the Peel Activator Serum over the Derma-Crystals, massage for up to a minute and rinse off.  Use the treatment weekly...if you can wait ;)	*The treatment feels great.  The Derma-Crystals felt so good I'm always tempted to continue massaging it in longer than suggested and the Peel Activator Serum has a very mild warming sensation upon application.	*Noticeable Results.  After rinsing the treatment off I can immediately see smoother, cleaner, more vibrant skin.  It's as if a dull layer has been lifted.  My skin tone is more even and pores even appear smaller.  Several days after the first treatment my skin still felt and looked better.  More than one of my friends commented on how great my skin looked and/or asked what I'd been doing different.	*Inexpensive and easily available.  You can find the kit in drug stores or online for $20-30.  The kit last about 2 months when used 1-2 times a week!	Cons:	I have noticed that my skin seems slightly oilier than normal the day after a treatment.  This is so slight and and the benefits are so noticeable that this is certainly not a deterrent for me and I will continue to use the product!"
B000F63TW0,2011,8,2.0,5,5,77,"wasn't worth it","I was hoping for more significant results with this. I used it consistently every week for 3 months, most of the time twice a week like it said, and didn't think it gave me any better results than a regular exfoliator. Didn't do much of anything for my acne, large pores, and blackheads. It wasn't worth the price to me, paid about $30 for it, I would of rather invested that money in buying a chemical peel."
B000F63TW0,2011,8,5.0,5,5,152,"Great Product","I've been using this product and some of the other products from the Regenerist line of products for several months.  After just one use of the Olay Regenerist MicroDermabrasion Kit, I noticed an improvement in my skin.  My skin felt softer and had a little glow to it.  One of my friends at work even told me that she's noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin; that I have a glow.  It's most effective when I use twice per week, if I get out of the habit of using it, I always return to it when my skin starts to look dull.  Some of the light discolorations from sun damage in my skin have faded since using it.  It seems to keep my breakouts at bay and it smells wonderful.  I use it at the end of my shower, very easy to use and convenient.  This is a great product!"
B000F63TW0,2011,6,5.0,5,5,108,"What can I say? I love this product!","My dry, sensitive, acne prone skin as a teen became dry, sensitive acne scarred as an adult. Someone suggested that I try microdermabrasion but, unfortunately, my budget did not allow for regular spa visits. On a whim (and because I love the Olay brand) I decided to give this a try.	Application is very easy and takes only a little more time than I would spend washing my face in the morning. Immediately, I noticed the smooth texture of my skin. With continual use, my acne scars have faded away and my worry lines are less noticeable. Overall my skin's elasticity has improved along with chronically dry patches."
B000F63TW0,2010,4,5.0,5,5,133,"Noticeable improvement in short time!!","You will be blown away by this system from the first use!! It feels and smells great on your skin. My skin felt so soft, smooth and clean. (I use as directed, which is twice a week.) It even worked on a red little bump that I've had for about 6 months. After just a couple uses, I noticed that it was gone.  I had tried my favorite herbal mask, neosporin - I even tried to pop it.  Nothing worked, except this.  The absolutely exciting moment for me was when we were at a party and my brother-in-law said my face looked so clean and refreshed. My sister added that my face looked great. For others to notice was just amazing!! And at 43, I'll use anything that gets that kind of reaction!!!"
B000F63TW0,2009,11,3.0,5,5,115,"have yet to see a difference","I purchased this product based on reviews from another website. This is my first time to use Olay product. I have normal to oily skin and dry during the winter months. The microdermabrasion and peel kit is easy to use and makes my skin very soft. It's also gentle enough to my acne prone skin. I used the kit twice a week for the past 3 weeks and so far, my skin does not appear any different. And no one in the family has noticed i'm using a new product (some reviews claim to have radiant skin after only 1 use). I will continue to use till it's gone and hope to find something better."
B000F63TW0,2008,11,5.0,5,5,388,"A Fantastic Product!","I am SO glad i purchased this system although i did find it cheaper elsewhere (7 bucks cheaper).	I have only used it once but WOW! I almost didn't use it last night because i thought my skin was already pretty smooth but i couldn't resist - i was just too excited.	First, let me say that i am 19, a college student. When i first went to college for many months my acne progressively got worse. I tried Proactiv but it was too drying, other drugstore brands (that used to work until my skin worsened), and even went on a prescription for a month for acne (i hated it).	Then i just started using generic apricot scrub (i like equate) and slowly things got a bit better.	Then i began trying products to retain moisture - and i LOVE the olay serum for that. Having success with olay encouraged me to try this system.	I wanted to try it because while much of my blemishes are gone, my skin doesn't look very healthy. I have some scars that blend with my freckles and my skin tone looks terrible. I wanted professional microdermabrasion  but i am a college student - not gonna happen.		Luckily i did splurged and spent $[...] on this kit and i am so glad i did.	It has removed some of the dry skin patches near my nostrils and left my skin even softer! Softer than i ever imagined!	From one persons review stating that this shouldn't be done at home i was unsure about this product but i want to let everyone know that this kit is not as abrasive as i worried it might be - it just works. However, if you have a lot of breakouts, it might be wise to get it under control before using this (just a thought). But on my one small blemish it was fine.	Also, the combination of the apricot scrub daily and this system have greatly reduced my blackheads. And i recommend using the regenerist serum after using this kit - the two do wonders.		This kit and the serum will be in my skin care kit FOREVER! For a college student, this is a bit pricey - but it works! So stop wasting money on cheaper things that don't work and try this."

I have very sensitive skin and with many products I have had allergic reactions to but this product is fantastic and leaves the skin feeling smooth.  If you call the company's customer relations department, you may be able to try it first with a coupon. I had an issue with another Olay product (I was allergic to it) and they compensated me with a discount coupon. This product was chosen and now I'm hooked. Considering I have such sensitive skin, I really thought it would be to harsh but it cleaned my skin leaving it looking beautiful.For a 40yo woman on the go, I would highly recommend this Olay product."

After debating whether to get the Neutrogena microderm kit with the little gizmo or this, I went with Olay. Tried it for the first time... it smells GREAT. Made my face feel a little hot, but once I rinsed everything off (you will need a washcloth) I was amazed with my glowing, smooth skin! I'm 40 and just beginning to experience duller, drier skin, but this stuff really reveals all the goodness underneath (and better than the L'Oreal kit, mind you).

B000F63TW0,2012,2,5.0,2,2,216,"Simply amazing!","Okies....As I investigated products for my own personal facial cleansing and treatment regimen, I, of course, soon became completely overwhelmed by the great beastie that is the beauty product world! I've not been good at keeping up with such things personally and I've found it so difficult by rote to trust product promotions anymore. I mean, they do and always have had an agenda after all. The majority not giving a toss that you're doling out your hard earned money hand over fist, battling within your budget whether to purchase food, pay your rent or buy their product-packed-with-promises instead.  Meanwhile...I finally did decide to take the plunge with this stuff and holy criminy it really does work wonderfully! I was impressed on the FIRST treatment!! I mean the very first treatment!:) I did follow up, as recommended, with the Olay serum and my skin felt like velvet. That is no exaggeration. I don't know when the last time was that my skin felt this soft and healthy. The product IS quality. I am in love and will do my best to always have it in good supply. THANK YOU for making something that really works!! Might sound like a simple concept but truly it really is the only thing that matters in the end.  Thank you.:)"
B000F63TW0,2012,1,5.0,2,2,219,"Confidence Regenerist","I loved this stuff so much that I HAD to write a review. I purchased this almost 6 months ago, and I didn't want to write a review right away without knowing the relatively long term effects. The Olay line is the first skin care line that I have ever used that doesn't cause my face to break out initially. The scrub is very fine and it feels good when you rub it on your face. The coolest part is adding the Lactic acid to the scrub, where you can see this white foam form in places where there is alot of dead skin cells, almost like hydrogen peroxide. The best part is that the scrub and acid smells so good! Guys, if you are reading this, don't hesitate to get this as a gift. I bought it for my mother, and BOTH of my parents now use it and love it. Despite the small amount of scrub and acid, a little goes a long way and it has lasted me about 6 months. The one con of the product (very minor) is that your face may become red after use, but only temporarily and it looks more like you have gotten sun kissed. Again, love this product and have switched all of my skin care products to Olay."
B000F63TW0,2012,0,5.0,2,2,139,"One of the best over the counter skin treatments I have ever used.","I have used the Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion & Peel 3 times over the past two weeks.  It makes my skin so soft & smooth, like silk.  The first few hours after using, my skin turned red, but when I woke the next morning, it was glowing,silky & beautiful.  It seems to have a generous amount in it, so it is also a very good buy for the money.. Several people have commented on how good my skin looked.  Some have even stated that my skin looks younger than some ladies in their early 30's.  I am 54, so I took that as a compliment.  I have been using Olay products for the past 9 years, although this was the first time I used the Microdermabrasion & peel.  I will definitely purchase it again when I start to run out."

I don't have acne spots or discolorations, but I definitely needed some blemish fighting treatment for my forehad and this is doing the job. I stopped using it for a bit because I was hooked on the Fresh products that are all-natural. I bought this, love it and intend to use it again after finishing my Fresh products.		I ABSOLUTELY recommend it to folks who DONT want to spend $50-$90  bucks on creams/exfoliators looking for the same effect. This is it."

B000F63TW0,2011,6,5.0,2,2,63,"Great Product","This is a great product. After using the product my face and neck was smoother than it has been in years.

It's very easy to do, and hand tiring too. I did notice results. The scrub smells so wonderful. When you apply the bottle solution thing over the crystals, it feels so nice, it makes your face warm too. You do feel like you had a facial, even better than a facial! It cleans out your pores completely. This does fully extend my nightly routine and soaks up all the products! Will continue to buy!"
B000F63TW0,2011,5,5.0,2,2,99,"Good stuff","I've been happy with all of Olay's products and this is no exception.  It hasn't produced an amazing transformation but it gets my skin very clean.  It sloughs away all of the old, dry skin and it must have something in it that numbs the skin slightly because it has less sensation when I apply lotion afterwards. It's warm but not hot and it doesn't make my skin itch or burn like some other treatments.  It also doesn't make me break out. Even other well respected brands cause that for me sometimes.  I've never experienced that with Olay's products."

I usually rub this product in for twice as long as the box says but when I am done, my skin is smooth and glowing with a fresh layer of skin. After doing this treatment, lotion goes on easier and my skin feels softer. I always feel healthy and glowing when I am done with this treatment. I usually follow up with Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque which tightens everything up. I love that this is such a quick thing to do but it has such remarkable results. Also, you get a good amount of treatments even though it looks like a small amount of product. Besides, you only use this product once a week or once every two weeks so you don't have to buy a new one for awhile."

After going almost broke buying the philosophy version (I am a huge philosophy fan), I was recommended this by one of my girlfriends who said it was similar. It's awesome. I use it once a week for a deep clean and exfoliation. Highly recommend! If it's too abrasive using it on a dry face, dab a little water on your face first to cream it up a little bit....works like a charm!"

He had some acne, but his biggest annoyance was these largish hard white bumps nearly everywhere.  He was religious about cleaning his face, and was exhausted from trying a zillion products with no positive results.  Thanks to Amazon and the reviews here he ordered this.  In ten(ish) days his face was nearly healed and glowing.  Even now, only when he hasn't used it for a couple of weeks does his acne start to become an annoyance again.		My face wasn't in bad shape, but I sure noticed a difference in how clear and even my skin is now.		We both love this stuff!		Remember:  Don't use it more often, or leave it on longer than is recommended in the instructions.  Your face will look and feel like it's raw and burning."

When i found it here on Amazon at half the price i was thrilled. I leave it on for 5 minutes because i do not have sensitive skin. I wiped off the product with a warm wet cloth and my wrinkles had relaxed as though i'd just come from the spa. I use a beauty tip from the stars and apply a dab of preparation H to the corners of my eyes, mouth and frown lines then use my daily moisturizer all over. Be careful not to get any products into eyes. The pre-H helps sooth swollen skin and decreases and left over wrinkles. This beauty tip has been around for many years. Good luck."
B000F63TW0,2011,1,5.0,1,1,52,"Love it!","I bought this to help minimize my large pores. I use this twice a week along with Clinique pore serum and I'm seeing results after one month!

What I Liked:		The crystals (""Step 1"") have a pleasant orangey smell, as other reviewers have noted.	The combination did seem to do a pretty good deep-cleaning of pores.	My skin was softer afterwards.	My skin also seemed brighter.		Nonetheless, I'm disappointed.  The product promises ""diminishing fine lines"" and this did not happen.  Also, it does feel as if the process stirred things up a bit, in that I have certain tell-take signs that I didn't have before use of an imminent breakout.		If they offered a money-back guarantee, I would take it."

I usually use proactive solution, but this did something proactive doesn't do. It has a warming sensation and smell great. It does a light peel as you rub it into your skin, and afterwards you see a more soft and even tone to your skin. It worked wonders after the first time. I never write reviews and I've only used this product once, so that should tell you that this is a great product. I would definately recommend this product."

B000F63TW0,2009,6,5.0,2,2,87,"Wonderful product","I have been pleasantly surprised by this product. Most exfoliators and dermabrasion kits are very harsh. This product is simple to use and leaves my skin quite soft and light feeling. The first time I used this product it was very odd to me. The warmth from the serum took me by surprise. I have very sensitive skin and I have been using this once a week for a few weeks now. I have had no irritation from it. Once again, Olay has made a quality product."
B000F63TW0,2008,10,5.0,2,2,79,"Great Product","I bought this product in a drug store when I ran out of a more expensive department store version of this product that I've been using for years. I must say that I am very loyal to that brand. However this product is just is good as their's for less than 1/2 the price. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to get anything of quality at this price point... And I will definately be purchasing again. Love!!!"
B000F63TW0,2006,7,4.0,2,2,80,"A really great exfoliant...","After going back and forth between Oil of Olay and Neutrogena I settled on this product mostly because of the price (plus no one complained about the granules getting into their eyes.) I'm happy with the results- my skin is softer and appears to have taken on more clarity. The orange smell is lovely and it only takes two minutes (I do it in the shower.) Of course, it's not microdermabrasian, but it is a great exfolliater for your skin."

B000F63TW0,2012,7,1.0,4,5,169,"Made me break out","Well.  I suffer from cystic acne.  I hadnt had any breakouts in a while and i wanted to try this because of all the great reviews.  Unfortunately it was not for me.  The first time I tried this, my face was red and blotchy, but that was expected.  The next day, i woke up with white heads and cysts  on my chin.  I decided to give it a chance so I used it 2 more times.  Each time I used it i would have small red blotches that would then turn into pimples the next day.  Like I said, I have cystic acne so these cysts take forever to go away.  I tried to give it a chance, but it really wasnt good for my skin at all.  It did make mt skin soft, but That doesnt matter if my face is going to have painful cysts on it.  I love olay products,  this one.....not so much.  Also, the 2nd step in the microdermabrasion never foamed like it claimed,"
B000F63TW0,2010,9,5.0,4,5,180,"Simply put...it's AMAZING!","I've lived most of my life in Southern California, the land of sunshine, and I'm outdoors a lot; sometimes for many hours exercising, working, or at outdoor events. In the process I've had a lot of sun exposure and I've often neglected to apply enough sunscreen (or any at all.) The damage was extensive enough that I went through thousands of dollars of laser treatments. Those certainly helped, but got really expensive. So, with all the hype from the commercials I figured I would spend a lot less and give this product a shot. Wow! Not only does it work, it has far exceeded my expectations! In just a couple of uses I saw noticeable fading of sun damaged areas all around my face; cheeks, nose, temples, and forehead. Spots that were barely helped by laser were much better after using this product.		I just wish I knew about OLAY Regenerist before I spent so much on those other treatments...I would have skipped them altogether!		Ps. I use the OLAY Regenerating Serum every day. I think the combination is excellent."

It ruined my complexion!","I purchased this system because I felt that at 42 years old, it was finally time to slow or even reverse progression of my fine lines and wrinkles.  I have never had sensitive skin, nor acne so wasn't concerned about that at all.  Well, now I have it, thanks to this product. After first use, I noticed a ton of tiny bumps on my right cheek and another small patch of them on my neck.  Not knowing exactly what caused it, I decided to use the product one more time, a week later.  Well, the product is definitely the problem.  My entire face and neck is now covered with these tiny bumps!!  The only area on my face without these bumps is my eye area, where the product doesn't go!!  I can only hope these will go away on their own.  Back to my old routine of simply washing my face with a mild cleanser, then covering up with cream. Sigh..."

It does all what it promises and let me tell you something, I tried all types of products before (even organics)and nothing had worked for me before. The glow and tightness that this product gave me after rinsing it off and drying my face, reminded me of when I was 15 years old.  Yes, I am that serious! This product is that good to my face, I highly recommend it."
B000F63TW0,2010,6,5.0,1,1,192,"LOVE IT!!!!!","I was scared to use this at first because I have sensitive skin but I finally just tried it. I was having an issue with my skin looking dull, large pores, and little blackheads on my nose. I followed the directions exactly for fear of messing up my face lol. My skin felt very smooth afterwards. It took a day or so and I noticed my complexion was not so dull and my pores were smaller. I waited a few days and did it again and this time I vigorously scrubbed where my large pores and black heads were. I did get a little dry this time but applied a good moisturizing face cream before bed for several days. My pores are barely noticeable and my black heads are GONE. My complexion is bright and clear. I use it weekly and sometimes will do it twice a week but I wouldn't do it twice until you know what your tolerance to the product is. I also added a dab of Neosporin to my face lotion at bed time just to help it heal faster and to prevent the itchy, burning, dry feeling."

I have ultra sensitive skin and I haven't gotten any pimples from it (though I put my usual benzoyl-peroxide lotion on after). I just wanted to make the note that if you have acne-prone skin you don't have to be afraid to use this, if you continue to use your usual acne-fighting products. I don't see any harm in trying this product but I don't really think it has the same scar-removing potential as a real medical/spa procedure.

I only use it 2x a month - found 1x a week was still too much for my skin; I'm fair with somewhat sensitive skin.  For the money, it's worth it - I had tried the ""Philosophy"" brand - way too expensive comparatively speaking.  This does the same job for 1/2 the price.  I use it when I notice my skin looking a tad dull & it definitely brightens up your complexion, removing the dead, flaky skin to reveal a fresher face."

I'm 50 years old and I don't believe anymore in the Spas or expensive facials. I thought this product was easy to use, safe and gave results after the 3rd time I used it. From the first application, my skin became soft. But after the 3rd one, I could see an overall change simply because once all the dead skin cells eliminated by microdermabrasion, my creams and serum had the chance to actually hydrate and nourrish my skin. It give absolutely nothing to buy expensive products if we don't remove the make up residu, the dead skin cells and the pollution dust that we cummulate through the year. This product is affordable but must be used gently. I have a normal skin.I don't recommend for sensitive skin or acnea. Otherwise, it's a great microdermabrasion. I recommend it."

I think the purpose of using your fingertips is to give my control and realization of pressure you are using on your face. I applied with a wash cloth a couple of times (taking the 'no pain, no gain' approach) but it didn't work any better- my face just stayed redder, longer, without any different result. I can see someone doing damage if they scrubbed too hard.		Overall, it was a great value and worth a try, and did improve my skin slightly"

In 2 weeks of treatments with it and Boots No7 Total Renewal facial scrub my esthetician was AMAZED at the results I had accomplished AT HOME! Much better than any treatment she could have offered me would have made my skin (they did lactic and glycolic peels only, nothing like salicylic or higher that has to be done in a doctor's office, obviously those would produce more results). You get a LOT of treatments with one set, even though I go heavy on it and have found that I should add step 2 to the crystalized mask more than once, as it makes the crystal dissolve, if you use it until all the crystal are dissolved I feel you get the best results! I believe in saving your money to get the higher cost treatments through doc offices, that produce DRASTIC results in one visit, but after I tried this I don't know if I could cut it out of my beauty regimen!! My skin was noticeably smoother and had more glow that even my dad (who is SUCH a MAN) noticed the difference right away without being prompted!

I have had problem skin all my life, and for the past couple of years I have had bumps on the right side of my face.		I have tried many different creams, spa facials, even had a real microdermabrasion treatment many years ago (which was HORRIBLE, my skin felt like it had been scraped off with sandpaper). Very painful, then my skin looked literally burned for about one week, then after that I saw absolutely no improvement in my skin. Total waste of time and money, and it was not cheap.		Well, this product is the exact opposite of that.  This product feels great on my skin, I love the way it foams, I love the ease of application, I love the smell, and I love, love, love the way my skin feels after.

Really amazing product that I would definitely purchase again!"
B000F63TW0,2011,5,5.0,2,2,218,"Use with an electric toothbrush for even better exfoliation!","This is the BEST facial scrub I've ever tried! I love the concentrated, sandy texture. (I wish they made a version for body, too.) I started using this 5 years ago after seeing a video review by Michelle Phan. Following her advice, I used an electric toothbrush to apply the scrub to my face in small circles for a minute or two. (You can buy a kids' electric toothbrush at drugstores for $5 but it works great on its own too!)  It worked wonders on my oily, dull, acne-scarred complexion. I agree with another reviewer- you'll look like you just had a facial after using this! I use this at night, once a week, and then apply 2 squirts of Lumene Vitamin C Energy Cocktail to my face and the next morning my skin is GLOWING! My face is smooth, soft, my complexion looks so much more even and I just look healthier.  I love, love, LOVE this scrub! I definitely recommend this to anyone who has a dull complexion or skin that looks ""stressed out"". If your skin is sensitive, skip the toothbrush and the activator (step 2) and just use the scrub. I used to skip the a activator serum because it irritated my skin and broke me out but now my skin can tolerate it."
B000F63TW0,2011,4,4.0,2,2,220,"Truly works and great buy for price","I rarely buy items like this one, but lately I have been noticing some brown spots on my face and the appearance of fine lines. After two kids I think I am beginning to age a bit more rapidly and wanted to do something about it without spending a lot of money! At any rate I have now used the product on 3 occasions (over a 6 week period) and I have seen improvement. Immediately after the first use I saw improvement in the texture and appearance of my skin. I think the product is too strong for weekly (or twice weekly) use as the instructions suggest. I use the product once every other week and I have seen reduction in a couple of brown spots that were particularly bothersome to me and less noticeable lines around my mouth nose area. I bought this product in combination with the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and I have also seen a reduction in breakouts and feel I have cleaner more radiant skin. I would say that those with sensitive skin should be careful as I do notice some sensitivity in my skin for a day or two after use and I use it much less than recommended. For the price and the outcomes I think this was a great buy!"

Its super easy to use too and it smells great. I do it right before I go to bed and follow up with a nice moisturizer. When I'm done with the treatment, my face is smooth, has a nice toned look and remains so for 2-3 days, it has definitely diminshed smaller wrinkles(or appears to have anyways) and it has helped signifigantly with clearing up break outs and fading acne scars. I can't wait to see what it does in a few months. Excellent product. I will be buying it again."
B000F63TW0,2011,2,5.0,2,2,49,Amazing!,"After using it once, I am just amazed. The moment I washed the product off and looked in the mirror, I thought to myself, WOW. My skin not only felt soft, but it looked like it was glowing. All the little imperfections in my skin were gone. LOVE IT!"
B000F63TW0,2011,1,4.0,2,2,142,"My face is baby soft!","Used this for the first time last night--and I have to say I am please with the feel of my face after wards.		I'm giving it 4 stars, only because the crystals seemed a bit rough on my skin, and kind of burned (which was the point, I suppose) and the foaming action isn't exactly what I had expected. That and I think the liquid that tops the crystals should be more plentiful.  You only need a quarter size amount of crystals, but to cover them and massage, you need about twice the liquid, and thus far I'm thinking the crystals will outlast the liquid foamer.		Even still--face feels fantastic--hoping to see some more even tones in the uses to come.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and I can say I was able to use this without any redness, drying, or breakouts."

B000F63TW0,2009,11,5.0,2,2,199,"Love It","Now in my mid 30's I started to see the signs of aging around my eyes and my forehead. I have also noticed the pores on my nose, chin and upper cheek area enlarging and collecting dirt (black heads). I have sensitive skin and have been known to give myself chemical burns from such products as Proactive and Clearasil, so I wondered if I was going to damage my skin from this product.		Ok well I received it yesterday and gave it a try right away. I LOVED IT. It did not burn my skin, left no residual redness, cleared my blackheads up in one application, my pores appeared smaller immediately and left my skin feeling smooth and new. Followed the treatment with Oil of Olay Regenerist 7 in 1 cream.		Seems as if the smaller bottle of activator will run out way before the crystallized cream however. I will have to wait and see. Often that is the case  when you buy a two part system one part of the system runs out before the other, quite frustrating!		Bottom line, I would recommend this product to anyone. It is never too early to start a skin care regimen."
B000F63TW0,2012,11,4.0,68,69,213,"Traditional Peel","Olay knows how to make skin care products. The peel does precisely what it's intended to do. It clears my face, gives me a fresh look. I'm thrilled right after I take it off. But it's a chemical peel- by the next day, I feel dry. The product works, it really does, but it doesn't provide enough moisture for my skin to keep it glowing after the peel process settles. The solution to that problem? I tried all kinds of creams- they left me feeling heavy. My friend recommended a retinol cream which I fell in love with -. I like to keep as light and natural as possible, and it seems to do the trick. There are tons of options out there but if you're like me and you like to go 100% natural, then here's my suggestion: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009WK0M6G"">Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 oz. + FREE St. Ives Renewing Collagen Elastin Advanced Body Moisturizer Gift Set</a>.  Its a thick cream but still absorbs really good so I'm not constantly reapplying. It keeps my skin healthy and glowing after using the peel and each day until I decide to peel again. I'm not flaky or strained anymore after using it. My hands don't get greasy and my pores aren't clogged either."

B000F63TW0,2006,10,4.0,40,41,153,"Wonderful mini-facial in less than 3 minutes!","I read about this product in the Parenting magazine and decided to give it a try. After the first use itself, I saw wonderful results. Skin feels so soft and supple and it seems like those blemishes are hidden.I use it every week and I recommend it for anyone who does not have the time to go out for those one hour facials every other week but can manage to spend a few minutes in the shower using this product.		The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 starts is because I observed that you have to very gently rub the product into your skin and if you are not very gentle, you might end up with red spots or a burnt skin. This happened a couple of times but now I am very careful and very gentle whil rubbing this product into my skin. I still highly recommend it."
B000F63TW0,2009,4,3.0,29,30,67,"Good, but those with sensitive skin or acne beware","This product is great for those who have normal skin and no/occasional acne. It gets rid of all the build up on your face and leaves skin looking fresh.	However, if you have sensitive skin or are prone to breakout (like myself) then don't waste your money. It's too harsh and left my face feeling red as well as scratchy. I broke out the next day too."
B000F63TW0,2006,1,5.0,27,30,213,"Don't Waste Money on Facials! This is IT!","I was really skeptical about trying this because as usual why would something off the shelf work? But I am impressed and really satisfied with the results! I know my skin well and I have aggressive skin so I used the product every other day. I wish I had taken before and after photos because it has done miracles. I have acne prone skin as well and have continued to use Proactive Solution for that, although gently. This product made my skin firm and shrinked my pores and I am confident that it is the only over the counter product that will give you professional results. I have stopped wasting money on facials, although facials are good, but this product give me the glow I need on a daily basis! The underlying factor about dermabrasion is to remove dead skin andthis product does that-just be careful if you have sensitive skin, you really should then follow the instuctions carefully. Also, I was debating between this and the Nuetrogena product, but went with Olay Regenerist because it was about $10 bucks cheaper, given that Nuetrogena gives one cream and that gadget thing, and Olay has a cream and a pealing serum and you do the work with you fingers, which i really do prefer."
B000F63TW0,2006,1,5.0,13,13,95,"Soft Skin!","I have used this twice along with the other products in the Regenerist line. My skin is very,very soft!		It smells fantastic! Like oranges.		The only thing I dont like about it is when you apply the derma-crystals (step one) you have to rub it in for a minute and it really is uncomfortable! It feels just like rubbing sand on your face.		The first time I used it I felt like I had a ""sunburn feel"" on my face. But it went away after a couple days. I follow this with the Daily Serum."
B000F63TW0,2009,10,5.0,20,22,231,"Give this a second try...","If you follow the instructions on the back of the box, this product will not work as well as it could. The instructions say to rub the microdermabrasion treatment on clean skin and then to follow with the peel activator serum. This is all fine advice if you want a mediocre peel.		The second time I tried this product a few days later I washed my face and left my skin damp and then rubbed in about a teaspoon of the microdermabrasion that I first ran under a little water. Adding a little water and having your face moist seems to be key. I then added about a teaspoon of the peel activator serum and noticed that it was distributing itself far more thourally than without the additional water. The second time my skin was completely soft and there wasn't a trace of dry skin. Do rub the products on your face for the full time - 1 minute for each product.		You may also find you enjoy this as a hand treatment. I found it exfoliates the hands very well and will leave them smoother and softer just after one treatment.		For maintenance (if you are only using the microdermabrasion once every two weeks) I'd recommend you use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012J30PU"">Olay  Regenerist Thermal (warms up) Mini-peel, 6-Ounces</a> and Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub 6.5 fl oz (192 ml).		~The Rebecca Review"
B000F63TW0,2005,11,5.0,153,191,151,"I love this stuff...","Buy this product and you will feel like you had a facial, seriously.  I have used it twice and my skin felt ultra soft.  This kit is easy to use,  simply rub the crystals on your face for about 1-2 minutes.  The crystals are like a salt scrub.  Then put the peel serum directly on top of the crystals and rub for about 1 minute (it will feel warm on your skin).  Then rinse throughly with warm water. Less than 5 minutes and you are finished! The kit looks like you could use it 10-20 times before running out. Be careful not to get it near your nostrils and eyes.  After using this kit, my pores were less noticable and my skin wasn't red like most products will do.  For $30, it isn't too expensive and you will actually save money by not going to a spa for a monthly facial."
B000F63TW0,2012,2,5.0,232,292,175,"WoW! Highly recommend it!","The 2 step process is ingenious.		The 1 step peel doesn't work as well (glycolic acid peel). This 2 step product package by Olay gives you professional results and makes you look half a decade younger.		I thought it was a placebo effect until my husband tells me what I did to my skin and that I look a lot younger after he came back from his 2 week business trip in Asia.		After 3 weeks of use, I notice a lot smoother skin with greatly reduced fine lines and wrinkles. I only use it 2 times a week because it is starting to get a little sensitive. I want to use it more often but don't want to risk it.		If your skin gets a little sensitive like mine, I recommend getting pure organic argan oil like this one <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z209HS"">Pura D'or Pure & Organic Argan Oil 4 fl. oz.</a> and apply a tiny amount over your face after this treatment to help protect and moisturize the area.

Even so, I called my sister and told her to get it. It's better then any mask, mud or home treatment I've used."
B000F63TW0,2010,6,5.0,4,4,195,"In a word - WOW.  Results like a facial!","I am 35 and very fair skinned, but live in a hot climate with lots of sun... so I get sun damage even though I wear 30spf minimum daily.  That being said, my skin is fairly line-free, but has some combination dry/oily/scaly issues due to prescription acne medication that I use.  I was looking for something that would do a great exfoliation and help even out my skin tone.  I am astounded by the results!		Most of the beauty products I have tried just don't live up to the hype - sometimes they feel nice and moisturizing for a day or so, but don't really have lasting results or make the skin look any different.  Immediately after this treatment (a whopping 3 minutes or so in total), my skin looked totally different... brighter, smoother, and younger!  Granted, I have never tried a microdermabrasion treatment before, so I can't compare to Olay's competitors, but WOW WOW WOW.  For a non-professional product, my skin looks as good as a $100 professional facial.  I also ordered the anti aging starter kit, so I'm looking forward to a whole new me at a price I can afford to maintain."
B000F63TW0,2010,5,5.0,4,4,120,"Awesome Product!","One word describes this product perfectly: WOW. I'm a pretty big skeptic when it comes to ""miracle products"", and I've used many exfoliating products in the past, including microdermabrasion systems, but this one beats them all.		Here's my routine, step-by-step:	- used a facial spa to open up pores (you can boil some water, put it in a bowl and cover your head with a towel over the bowl, if you don't own a facial spa)	- used the OLAY Microdermabrasion kit	- applied a thin layer of cold plain yogurt to my face and waited for it to dry. Great way to shrink pores.		I don't think my skin has ever been or felt smoother, after just one application!"
B000F63TW0,2008,5,5.0,4,4,29,AMAZING,"The Olay Regenerist System is amazing. This is my 2nd order of it. It makes my 50 year old skin look and feel like silk. I highly recommend it!"
B000F63TW0,2011,9,5.0,6,7,147,"Wow, really does work.","I'm a 40-something guy with large pores. Over the years I've tried several things including true Retinol-A which produced some good results but now just irritates my skin and makes it flake. Facial scrubs clean my skin but also leave it red and irritated for a day or two...I hate always looking like I have windburn.		So like others here I tried it and am sold after a single use. My skin is Supersoft and clean now with a glow but not irritated, pores look smaller or at least less visible. I've never touched Olay before (I'm a guy) but this product is great.		3/5/12 update: I still use this once sometimes twice a week and my face is much smoother and less-wrinkled and pores much smaller than 2 months ago. After each use I use a high quality moisturizer which I believe really enhances the process."
B000F63TW0,2007,5,5.0,6,7,102,"Buy it already!!","The OLAY Regenerist - Microdermabrasion & Peel Kit is amazing, really!  My face feels so smooth, I can't stop touching it. The applications is super easy and quick.  You massage in the Microdermabrasion gel for about a minute and then put the peel serum on top and it foams while you massage it in for about a minute then you wash it off with water and a washcloth and you're done.  I use mine with Olay's eye dermapods and their Regenerist serum and my face feels so soft and has gotten steadily more even.  Buy the kit and you won't be sorry!"
B000F63TW0,2012,11,5.0,3,3,127,"Holy Grail for me!","I've been wanting to try this system for years.  The reviews have always been great, but still I hesitated.  Finally, a male friend of mine said he uses this and he swears it's the best thing since sliced bread. He's 37 and I'm 41.  I figured, what do I have to lose.  Well, I got it in the mail today and used it tonight...I'm blown away by how &#34;healthy&#34; and &#34;refreshed&#34; my skin looks.  And this after only one use.  I absolutely love the warming effect.  It feels like I'm pampering my face.  I can't wait to see major improvements :-), or minor :-/  I'm just really excited about this stuff!  For informational purposes:  I'm 41 as stated, with oily, mild acne prone skin.  Also African American."
B000F63TW0,2012,6,5.0,3,3,272,"I was amazed at how well this works!","Because my face has been showing its age, I recently decided I needed to do something to improve my skin's quality and appearance.  My first thought was to get a chemical peel or microdemabrasion, but I thought I would try using Olay Regenerist after seeing the number of good reviews given here on Amazon.		Looking at the package I was surprised and disappointed at how simple the instructions were.  I expected this process to be complicated.  Spreading the two creams on my face I was surprised and disappointed that the product didn't sting and was barely warm at all.  Being fair-complected and freckled I was sure this product would have to hurt to work and would need to leave my face red and swollen to have any effect.  When it didn't burn or sting I was worried that this product was going to be a big waste of money and would have no affect on me.		BUT when I washed this product off my face I was absolutely amazed at how smooth my skin felt!  My cheeks were as soft and smooth as a baby's bottom.  I just could not believe what I was seeing.  I rushed out to tell my step mother and suggested she try the product as well.  A little while later she went through the same process and got the same excellent results.  We both plan to make this simple and inexpensive product a part of our weekly routines.		I rarely post reviews, but I felt like I had to tell you all about this great product.  I hope you have the same excellent results that we did."
B000F63TW0,2012,3,5.0,3,3,60,Amazing!!!,"This product is much better than the sixty dollar high end version by Philosophy (Philosophy Microdelivery Purifying Peel).  I used this first and then tried the one by philosophy thinking it would be even better since it was a higher end much more expensive product.  Needless to say I was very disappointed and will be repurshasing this in the future."
B000F63TW0,2012,2,5.0,3,3,223,"Wow, this product is amazing!!","I've been wanting to get regular facials for some time now, but haven't been able to bring myself around to paying so much for them. After reading these reviews, I decided to give this Olay Regerenist kit a whirl, and let me tell you, I'm beyond ecstatic that I did!! After using it the first time, I didn't see much of a difference. But the instructions say to use it twice a week for best results, and this is an absolute must! Even after the second time, I could see such a difference in the quality of my skin. I take good care of my skin with cleansers, moisturizers and serums; however, the texture of it is smoother than I've ever felt it, fine lines are slowly disappearing (you know the ones around your eyes and between your eyebrows? Yep, smoothing away), and this product has solved my mild problem of skin flaking. Using this kit with my regular skin routine has solved any issues I've had during the dry winter (we'll see about the summer). I highly recommend this product to women of all ages - it's never to early to start! - but make sure to use it twice a week, if your skin isn't too sensitive. The price for this beats any salon facial and can look/feel just as good!!"
B000F63TW0,2011,10,5.0,3,3,144,"Quality Olay product like the rest","I love this stuff. I like it better than their spin brush.  The brush exfoliates and keeps your skin super clean and removes excess dead cells. This stuff leaves your skin baby smooth. Your skin is tight and fresh and clean and soft. I use it once a week. I have adult acne so I use 10% benzoyl peroxide day and night so my skin can get very flaky and dry looking, and although it'd be ideal to use this twice a week for super soft supple skin, I like to save it as I only really need it once a week. I wonder if twice a week would damage your skin in the long run as it is very exfoliating and works really really well. I prefer this over the brush allthough the brush is a one time purchase and this is not."
B00008ZPGA,2011,3,4.0,0,0,51,"It's okay, esp for the price","I'm not disappointed, but I'm not buying the hype after trying it. It does help...don't get me wrong, but it's not that great like others claim. It seems to be a decent moisturizer and perhaps a very very slight improvement on fine lines. I would buy again, just cuz it's cheap."

It is supposed to be worn under another heavy moisturizer.. However, I think it is moisturizing enough.  It might even be too moisturizing for my skin over the summer.		I use this product with Olay's Total Effects Anti Blemish creme. In the reviews it said that the product would dry out your skin.  I have mild acne, and proactiv and other topical cremes dried out my skin waaaay too much.  This product has been wonderful.  No breakouts-- and I have really sensitive skin."

B00008ZPGA,2004,3,1.0,15,24,211,Rash,"I bought this product last week.  3 days after using the product in the morning and evening my skin broke out into what I can only describe as some sort of rash manifesting itself in small lumps around my face and neck.  At first I though it might be acne, although was surprised at that being in my late twenties and never really prone to spots.  However, as the last couple of days have progressed the rash has significantly spread and is now covering most of my face and neck.  The little lumps are even appearing in my eyebrows and the soft area around my eyes.  This lumps are not only very unsightly and quite upsetting but are itchy as well.  My skin generally feels very tight and uncomfortable.  This has never happened to me before and I have no known allergies.  This product is the only alteration I have made in the last week to my skincare routine.  The location of the rash, only around my face and neck, also indicates it is likely to be this product that is causing this problem.  Since then i have checked various reviews on different websites and have now noted that this is a widespread problem - use this product at your peril!"
B00008ZPGA,2004,4,2.0,4,7,50,"small white bumps","I started using this product for about a month now.  My skin feels very soft, but small white bumps started to appear since I used this product.  I've never had this problem before.  A few other people I know have the same problem...so becareful not to use it too long."
B00008ZPGA,2010,5,4.0,4,4,189,"Keeps my skin feeling soft and moisturized","This is one of the few moisturizing products that I've actually ordered a second time.  Usually I use a bottle or part of one, get tired of it because it doesn't work as expected, and move on to another product.  This regenerating serum just works.  It makes my skin feel hydrated and soft without a greasy or heavy feel.  It absorbs quickly and is perfect under foundation or with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019ZF5T6"">Olay Definity Color Recapture, Light/Medium, 1.7-Ounce Box</a>.  It's also nice because it goes a long way.  Just two pushes of the pump, a couple of drops, is enough to moisturize my whole face.  So the bottle lasts a long time.		The only thing I didn't like as much about this serum is that I mistakenly ordered this one that has a light fragrance.  It's not overpowering or anything and it dissipates quickly, but I really prefer the fragrance free version.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CC64W"">Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl oz</a>		I'm not sure if it makes me look younger but it does seem to minimize the appearance of wrinkles.  It makes my skin feel good."
B00008ZPGA,2007,2,5.0,4,4,95,"I'm a Believer!","I started using this several months ago after seeing it chosen as the best by Consumer's Report.  Within a few weeks, I could see measurable improvement in my skin.  Sure, not all the deep wrinkles went away, but enough of the smaller ones smoothed away so my 58-year-old skin looks younger.		My skin feels so much smoother and looks fresh.  I've had a lot of sun exposure from living in Australia, South Texas and Florida, so I'm thrilled to find a cream that does such a good job.  Lots cheaper too than many skin creams."
B00008ZPGA,2006,11,5.0,4,4,84,"A ""Must Have"" for me","I received a sample with my newspaper one Sunday a couple years ago, and haven't been without it since.  It makes my skin feel great.  My foundation makeup goes on nicely over Regenerist because it creates an almost silky texture.		Some reviewers may think this product is pricey (I'm sure it's a bargain compared to some big department store cosmetic counter items) but it lasts a long time.  The serum spreads across the skin so smoothly that a small amount goes a long way."
B00008ZPGA,2011,1,5.0,6,7,266,"Took 5 years off my cat's face","4.5 stars from independent users for a skin product with its own marquee of miracle claims is kind of hard to pass up.  I'm a 26 y/o male, and my appearance is important to me.  Not because I'm ugly now, but I look at older people who're ugly and that's enough motivation for me to sleep in formaldehyde each night.		I often ask the most gorgeous and youthfully preserved mid-late 30's gents what their secret is, and unequivocally I've been told to start moisturizing religiously in my 20's onward (many of them recommended Oil of Olay; nay, swore by it.)  So, I have.  I'd begun to develop crows' feet from my love of laughing, which made me feel there was less to laugh about in life, renewing my interest in handsome products.		I'd researched the amazon and settled on this beauty.  I'd been using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E96LAO"">Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin Daily Moisturizer, SPF-15, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)</a> as a moisturizer for about a week prior.  It's a great moisturizer and its light diffusing properties are wonderful.  But the crows' feet remained.  I received the serum on Saturday and have used it for a total of 5 days and am happy to report that I've seen significant diminishment in those feet.  They're no longer noticeable unless you get right up in there and look.  It's also filled out my cheeks a bit more.  All in all, a very happy camper.  You can buy it at costco in a double-size bottle for $30, but it's still cheaper if you just buy it on Amazon with the auto-fill option."
B00008ZPGA,2008,7,5.0,6,7,557,"I have my young face back!","I've always had slightly oily skin, but aside from some normal breakouts as a teenager I escaped those awkward years with better skin than most.  I never used special cleansers or lotions.  I never really felt like I needed them.		When I became pregnant with my first child, one of the unfortunate side effects was my skin went, well, wonky.  I had weird breakouts, and it became extra oily in some places, but ridiculously dry and rough in others.  I tried different lotions, but they either didn't hydrate the dry parts enough or they caused the oily parts of my face to break out worse.  I hoped that my skin would improve, and it did in that it grew less oily, but the dry patches stayed.  Over the next two years I tried different kinds of cleansers, exfoliators, lotions, etc. but nothing worked.  The dry patches had become these red, tight, peeling nightmares and I despaired of finding anything that would help.		I read through some reviews of this product, and decided to try it.  I paired it with the Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream, and one Tuesday night I washed my face with a gentle cleanser and applied the serum, then the cream.  It's difficult to describe, but my skin actually felt better within minutes.  And I don't mean I ran my hand across my face and went ""oooh, ahhh,"" I mean just walking around the skin on my face felt, well, relieved.  It felt better hydrated than it had in quite some time, and the best part was it didn't feel at all oily.		I didn't expect overnight results, but I did see a noticeable difference the next morning.  My skin was far from perfect but it was improved, and much more so than I had hoped it would be.  It is now the first Sunday night after I started using these products, and I am absolutely astounded at the results.  The dry patches are gone, and there are a few remaining areas that look a little pinker than I'd like, but the redness has faded dramatically.  I have little doubt that it will go away completely before long.  My skin has become smoother, softer and it doesn't feel tight and dried out like it used to.  It also does not feel oily, and I haven't had any breakouts or other ill effects since I started using these.		I apply the serum and the cream once in the morning and once at night.  I considered buying the night cream, but I don't think I need to, since the results from these two products has been so dramatic.  I cringed at the price of just these two, so I see this as a way to save some money.  Given how little of the serum and the cream I need to use though, I think these little bottles will last me a while.  Regardless, the price was completely worth it for the results I've gotten.  I would highly recommend these products to anyone who is looking for softer, smoother, better hydrated skin.  I don't know about any anti-aging effects, and quite honestly I don't really care about wrinkles (I have some, but they don't bother me much).  I just want to feel good in my skin, and now thanks to Olay I can enjoy that again."
B00008ZPGA,2011,4,5.0,3,3,155,"Better than most for day & night","I have used Regenerist regenerating serum for the last 9 years.  I can't say for sure that my skin is better off than it would be if I had not used it but, I do know that my three older sisters have the same type of skin and they have wrinkly, saggy skin under there necks and we used to joke about it and I was told ""just wait a few more years when you hit your mid fifties you will have it too"", well I am nearly sixty and I am told all the time that my skin does not look that old. And under my neck is still firm and smooth.  It may not be the Olay but I have faithfully used if for years. I have never liked the feel of most creams, but this goes on so smootly and makes your skin feel like satin.  I would recomend it to anyone."

B00008ZPGA,2010,11,4.0,3,3,144,"Great moisturizer","Read the reviews...they aren't lying.  This is one of the few moisturizers I have ever used that actually moisturize extremely well with a totalling greaseless feel and appearance.  I'm only giving it a 4 because I was led to believe that it helped with aged spots.  This is simply not true.  It does nothing for age spots.  I have some redness on the brige of my nose and this serum seems to enhance the appearance of the redness, but it seems to subside some after a short while.  Moisture qualities scores a perfect in my opinion.  Doesn't do anything else.  If you are trying to fade age spots and even out skin tone I highly recommend Virtual Laser (it comes in a bottle...it's not a procedure).  Virtual Laser is by far the best product I've ever tried for hyperpigmentation and it's reasonably priced too."

To be very honest I wasn't aware if this was working or not because it's not like it's a miracle creme and transforms like plastic surgery. So, I acutally started using another creme on one side (just a basic lotion creme) and I used The Olay on the other side. After only a few days I noticed enough of a difference pointing that it's working for me and I continue to now use it on both sides! It's cheap and last at least a month depending on how liberally you apply, and it actually produces results! Olay is the way to go."

I was using so many creams and no help until my derm told me to look at specific ingredients that help reduce old wrinkles and protect against new ones and she mentioned olay...

It's too bad that products like these one only use stars to promote their products, because, if, Olay was to see me, they wouldn't believe it. I've been using Olay products for years and my skin shows just how well their products really do work. When you see stars on the TV; you're not sure if their telling you the truth or not, however, if they saw me, a, regular everyday person, that uses Olay products, I think their products would sale even more.

Some things I've noticed since using it over the past year-		1. Keeps my skin soft, but supple and tight.	2. Feels velvety smooth on my skin, and makes it feel clean and light-weight.	3. Some wrinkles forming along my brow have completely disappeared.	4. My skin looks and feels awesome!

After a few months they had not went away. I went to my dermatoligist and found out they are cysts common for babies to get. I am 30! I had to have it removed with a scalpal. I am not saying this is  definately from this product but these did appear during time of use and since they regenerate new skin it is seems this could be the possible cause. I am only writing this review to let people know to maybe only test small areas for a while when using this to make sure you do not get any skin problems."

The only thing that upset me were a few small white bumps, but my dermatologist explained that these were the impurities under my skin forcing themselves out.

I've been using it for about 4 months now and my skin feels soft all the time and never greasy feeling.  My advice is to get over the cost and try it.

I'm not sure if this product will hydrate enough when used by itself in the winter.

A few days ago I noticed that the area around my eyes (the only place I use these products) was getting dry and itchy, and today I saw that I've developed little red bumps. They're not pimples, they're some kind of dry, itchy bumps and I've never seen them before. Also, while my skin and fine lines do look better after applying these products, I'm pretty sure that my skin actually looks worse now (more dry and more pronounced lines) when I wash them off, i.e. I think the products may ultimately be having a damaging effect on my skin. The products also contain several ingredients that are considered toxic to natural product aficionados. I'll need to research that more to know if there's any basis for the claim, but I'd suggest you do your homework too. For now, I'm discontinuing use of both products.

PROS:	- fragrance free and it doesn't have chemical smell	- I use this serum after toner and before moisturizer. It helps my skin lock in the moisture from moisturizer overnight keeping my skin nice and soft :)	- it's a very light formula; can barely notice I have an extra product on my face	- light small bottle, easy to travel with	- a small amount goes a long way. 1.7 ounce usually lasts me about 3+ months (i usually use it at least twice a day)	- turn pump to lock (won't pump out any serum by accident)	- I do notice my acne scars and blemishes fade faster (maybe because the serum really helps my skin cells regenerate faster??)

What's worse, I have broken out badly - big pimples that also itch, so not sure if it's a breakout or an allergic reaction - either way, no thanks. I might continue to use it under my eyes where my skin is drier just to see if it helps with the fine lines there (only because there are so many positive reviews), but definitely won't be using again on my face/neck/decolletage."

I was using all 3 Regenerist products, pink stuff and then serum and then sunscreen lotion. I stopped using because I got lazy. However, in November, tried it again one morning and did not wash it off that night. Next morning I woke up with a deep red rash which looked like a severe sunburn. I had no rash on my forehead or on most of neck or on cheek areas nearest to hairline or area under my nose. My chin, nose and cheeks were itchy, burning and red and I looked like I fell asleep in the sun for hours. I truly still did not think it was the Olay. I went to a dermatologist and he told me to test on forearm which provoked no rash at all. My face rash took about 4-5 days to subside fully and I actually decided it was probably not the Olay but possibly maltitol in the low carb chocolate I ate each day because a friend had experienced an immediate rash on her face after trying the De-Lite dark chocolate. Anyway, I did not use Olay again until last week. The same exact thing happened! I was bright red by morning, itchy, burning and swollen. The dermatologist did not understand why I looked as though I had a mask on that was bright red. He said there must be something either I'm ingesting or putting on my skin which is causing photosensitivity. It's been 4 days and I am still pink. I would love to hear from anyone else who this may have happened to. The patch test still came out okay and I also don't understand why my forehead and most of my neck and around the outside of my face was clear.

I asked him what he used and he looked around the store to see if the coast was clear before saying, ""Oil of Olay. Although I probably shouldn't tell you that."" I have used Oil of Olay ever since and had great results.		My problems comes in with this Serum. I feel like I am putting something terribly bad on my face. Oil of Olay's products tend to fill in the lines with mineral oils or silicone, which once absorbed, do a great job, but similar to Blistex---your skin becomes addicted, and if you stop using the product, you skin goes to rubbish.		My great friend swears on coconut oil for a million things, including facial moisturizer. I decided to use the Serum for two weeks and coconut oil for two weeks on different parts of my face. The side with the coconut oil had better texture, tightening and my skin looked a lot more readiant. The serum made my skin look good when on, but out of the shower it was a little 'eh'. Coconut oil is also about $10 cheaper and will last forever.		I am not saying that is for everyone, but I find that the best products for rejuvenating my skin and hair have been coconut oil based and that is a really great find when you are paying at least $20 for a couple ounces of Serum."

The sad and hilarious thing is that most consumers mix up makeup effects with real skin improvement.		The Regenerist contains SILICONES that fill in small wrinkles and mattify the skin surface thus acting like an invisible makeup. Such effects lead most consumers to believe their crow's feet are smaller. If you really want to do a test, you should stop using the product for a few days using only face wash. If during that time you observe smaller wrinkles then the product works. Or you could do a split face test - apply only on one side of face and use the other as base line control. You can't really claim the wrinkles are smaller while the product is on your face covering them HELLO ! It's like claiming wearing makeup improves the skin below LOL		And another thing, a wrinkle can't be erased in one or 3 weeks - the skin doesn't produce collagen that fast unless you wound it and that's the point of most laser procedures which work unlike most creams and lotions.		Paying $18 / 1.7 oz (retail price, its cheaper on amazon but you have to pay shipping price) for a silicone makeup is a little steep for me provided that there are cheaper products on the market that will make your skin look equally good cause they contain the same silicone base even better -  try Monistat soothing care - chafing relief powder gel 1.5 OZ, $7 at CVS.		I have been using Matrixyl(the active peptide in Regenerist) for 6 months in my own formulations (without silicones) and frankly speaking haven't noticed any improvement in my crows feet or the lines on my forehead. Currently there is only one study of the effects of Matrixyl conducted by Sederma - the MANIFACTURER of Matrixyl which makes me quite suspicious about the whole story. Manufacturers often wildly exaggerate any minor positive result for the obvious financial interest."

Frankly, I tired of paying out so much money for skin care products and had used Olay before as a teenager and decided to try it again.  I am very glad and satisfied that I turned back to Olay"
B00008ZPGA,2004,6,4.0,34,36,124,"Extremely pleased!!","This product has become a staple in my skin care regimen! It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth and the results were noticeable after only a few days. I did try the regenerist eye as well, and honestly, it's a waste of money. This product is gentle enough for around the eyes and does a much better job. I had problems  for years with white bumps around my eyes before I started using this product, and they have all cleared up and not returned. It's a tad bit sticky at first, but not bad enough to re-wash my face, and I'm very particular about anything greasy or sticky on my skin. Well worth a try. Great price, great product.

I recently discovered Paula Begoun and her books ""The Beauty Bible"" and ""Don't go to the cosmetics counter without me"" and she highly recommends Olay Regenerist. At that time, I was just finishing up my very expensive Guinot products, and decided to wean into Olay Regenerist including the Regenerating Serum, the Enhancing Lotion for the day and the Perfecting Cream for the night.		I was pleasantly surprised with the results! The Serum, which Paula says can also be used around the eyes as an eye cream, goes on smoothly and evenly and absorbs quickly. I love the way my skin looks and feels now and  people have noticed too!		If you can't afford to buy the Perfecting Cream or alternative cream for night, the Regenerating Serum is probably all you need (except for your day moisturizer with SPF)."

It seems to be lightening my under-eye circles.  I was afraid it would be too heavy for me because I have oily skin, but I was anxious to try it cause I'm 44 and also getting some wrinkles.  I've used it three weeks now, and it hasn't caused any breakouts."
B00008ZPGA,2005,0,5.0,17,19,152,"Better than Shiseido","I had been using Shiseido Renewing Serum for a couple months when I replaced it with Olay Regenerist Serum.  I have integrated the serum into my normal routine of Clinique 3-step between the astringent and lotion steps.  Now I wash, use astringent, then use Regenerist, and follow up with a tiny bit of lotion.  Once I've used the serum, I only need like half the amount of lotion I used to use to leave my face feeling really balmy.  I had had dry patches this winter before I started using the Shiseido in the same manner as the Regenerist and they had gone away but I still wasn't thrilled with my skin's overall condition.  However, I now feel like I have achieved skin nirvana with Regenerist and the price is 1/4 as much.  No dry patches, no oily patches, just evenly clear and hydrated skin.  I'll definitely keep this in my routine."
B00008ZPGA,2004,1,1.0,23,27,64,"Be careful!","If you have sensitive skin, beware. I tried a free sample and overnight it did make my skin baby soft, but then I broke out with huge under the skin blemishes. Ouch! It really irritated the skin around my eyes. I stopped using it right away and slowly it's going away. I was really disappointed. I had high hopes from the claims...just be careful."
B00008ZPGA,2010,9,3.0,9,9,238,"3-month trial","I decided to use both Olay Regenerist Daily Serum (Fragrance-free)and Olay Regenerist Eye Serum on ONE SIDE OF MY FACE, applied morning and night, for 3 months. I figured I could compare my skin quality, wrinkles, etc. on the Regenerist side against the side of my face on which I used no product at all. After 3 months, I noticed absolutely no difference on either side. As such, I can't say that these products have delivered on the anti-aging properties they tout. I'm 55 years old with generally good skin quality, but wrinkles would be nice to be rid of.		Their claims include:""Helps regenerate your skin's appearance without such drastic measures as chemical peels, cosmetic surgery or laser....Hydrates for firmer, visibly lifted, and younger looking skin without drastic measures. Instantly the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles is softened and your skin's texture is improved. Over time your skin will be visibly firmer and more elastic.""		None of this occurred in the 3 month test I did. So, why am I giving it 3.5 stars and still planning to use it? Because I have super-sensitive eyes that tend to burn and get irritated with most makeup and skincare products. Olay is in that rare group that I can tolerate. Also, I find that it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, goes on light, doesn't cause sneezing (fragrance free), and allows for extremely smooth makeup application when used under makeup."

I am 31 years old, go to law school at night, and care for my 2 small children during the day = lots of stress & no time for fancy skincare regimens.  Since using it, my combination skin no longer requires moisturizer for dry areas & astringent for the oily, so I just smooth on some of this serum before bedtime.  That's it.  Then, every other morning or so I put some on under my facial sunscreen, put some makeup on, & I'm out the door.  I feel like I sound like a commercial, but this stuff really is amazing.

I've been trying out several of the products out there, and I found ""Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream For Face and Neck"" to be one of the best ones around.		I really like this one alot because of the many benefits it has all in one jar. After using it pretty generously for a little over a month(I've used about 1/2 the jar so far), I found it worked wonders on improving the look and feel of my skin. It minimized the appearance of fine lines, really hydrated my dry skin, improving on firmness, absorbed deep into my skin, so using it every night, I could still feel the softness the next morning, and left my face feeling very smooth to the touch. I especially felt and saw visable result around my neck and throat area(where I am really starting to get that over 50 look).		It has a nice, very light scent, and here's the best part... The price here at Amazon is about 1/2 of what I paid when I purchased it along with my groceries at the market(and it was even on sale at the store), so at around twelve dollars here right now, it's a real bargain.

I just more recently took an interest in moisturizers and eye creams after I decided to quit tanning and rather preserve my youthfulness.  I use ""moisture therapy cream"" by Olay in the morning before I put on my makeup, and then I use this at night.  My skin always feels so soft, more soft than I think it ever did.  I can't give any testaments on its firming or anti-wrinkle ability, but I can say it does make my skin glow and my complexion look healthier.  The scent is great and it is a great smell to fall asleep to.		I would recommend this product to anyone of any age.  It has a good price compared to everything else on the market and I believe it is best to start moisturizing when you are young rather than waiting until the signs of aging have already begun.  Prevention is key!"

PROS: Has a nice clean smell, moisturizes very well, makes my skin feel smooth, gets rid of dry spots. Also, a little goes a long way. I still have 1/3 of the product left after 4 months.		CONS: Did not tighten/firm my skin whatsover. Did not prevent or smooth out any wrinkles as I noticed new wrinkles over time, and the smile wrinkles I have got worse and are more noticeable now. Lastly, this product made my skin look and feel VERY OILY. I don't like wearing the product around other people as the shininess is embarrassing.		This cream is basically good as a moisturizer if you have dry skin, but isn't really good for anything else. I can't say I'd recommend it, but looking at how other people have rated this, there is still a good chance that it could work well for you."

I like the way the cream feels when I apply it, like my skin is saying ""aahhh"".  The cream soaks in quickly and is not oily or sticky at all.	I can not give it a higher rating because I did not find it to be effective at firming.  In fact it did not leave my skin as hydrated as other products I have used.  I will finish my jar, but will not repurchase.	I am nearly 60 years old with fairly dry skin and I must need a need a more emollient product.  I think this one would work well for younger people."

I've tried other producs that make me breakout, but this cream did not. I'm enjoying it so far. My goals are to minimize wrinkles and get a good night moisturizer.

B00006JT6O,2012,0,5.0,1,1,80,"Great product.","I love Oil of Olay and have been using it for a number of years (the daily moisturizer). I got this night cream because I am now in my 40's and am noticing my skin is changing and becoming dryer. I used this cream and it instantly made my face feel softer throughout the day. Also, true to Oil of Olay, I don't have any adverse reactions such as blemishes. It is light and feels really good on my skin."
B00006JT6O,2011,10,4.0,1,1,174,"Light scent, not greasy, not too thick, I like it!","I've tried almost all of the Olay facial products and this is one of my personal favorites, especially because of the light scent (my husband has not complained about this one when we go to bed). I have normal-to-oily skin, so I have to make sure to use the right products that won't clog my pores. The cream seems to absorb well into my skin, so it does not feel greasy or thick. The price is affordable, especially on Amazon's Subscribe-and-Save Program, where you can set it up for 1-6 month automatic purchases at 15% discount and cancel at anytime without penalty. Sometimes I wish that it came in a pump-style (like it's sister products) instead of a jar, so that I can control the amount. I'm still on my first jar after 5 months BUT I do rotate in between products. Therefore, I gave it only 4 stars because I can't say that I've seen much of a difference on my skin though... Regardless, I would recommend this product to friends and family."
B00006JT6O,2011,10,3.0,1,1,182,"Too heavy and not enough results.","I was skeptical about Olay products.  I figured they spent a lot of money on advertising to get people to believe that their products actually worked.  But I'm 33 and my skin isn't exactly what it used to be so I went in search of some miracle creams.  I read all the reviews and tried Olay Regenerist Perfecting Cream Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream out first.  Within a week I felt a noticeable difference in my skin.  It felt smoother and more moisturized.  After two weeks I swore I started seeing a difference.  After a month my skin felt tigher and the blotches were evening out.  I figured all Olay products were similar so I wanted to try something else.  I picked this one and I'm not as happy with it.  It feels much heavier on my skin.  It has also caused me to break out slightly.  After this one has emptied, I will go back to the Olay Regenerist Perfecting Cream Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream and do the subscribe and save option.  Every two months seems to be the ideal time frame."
B00006JT6O,2011,8,5.0,1,1,114,"One of my favorite Olay products","So I have normal/dry skin and I usually opt for heavy moisturizers to get that rich, ""moisturized"" feeling, but that's just the problem; they're usually too oily.		With olay products it's either hit or miss for me, and this night cream is a winner.		It's so smooth and luxurious going on my face and at the same time it's light and refreshing. I wake up in the morning and my skin tone is noticeably more even and my skin is nice and smooth and plump (I'm 23, so don't really have an issue with lines or wrinkles just yet *cross my fingers*).

I am in my early forties and have crows feet on the sides of my eyes and furrow lines across my forehead.  I also have brown spots.  This product has not reduced my wrinkles and has not diminished the brown spots, so it does not do what I was hoping it would."
B00006JT6O,2011,10,2.0,5,5,97,"Made me break out","I'm in my mid 30's and I bought this for use only on my neck and jawline. I have combination skin, my neck isn't usually oily but this product made me break out. I gave it two stars instead of one because it works great on my hands! Obviously it's expensive for a hand cream but I didn't have to throw it in the trash because it didn't work the way I was hoping. If you have combination/oily skin try to get a sample of it first just to make sure it doesn't make you break out."

This cream has a pleasant scent and is very creamy and smooth.  A little goes a long way, and it feels nice on my face and neck.  It also seems to give me a fresher, smoother face and neck when I get up in the morning.  At my age, nothing natural works miracles, but I do recommend this cream.

B00006JT6O,2012,11,5.0,0,0,619,"Something that actually works","I read reviews all the time but never write any, but now I've decided to write because I appreciate the helpful reviews others have written that helped steer me in the right direction, so I want to give back and help others if I can. I've tried many products and for the most part have seen no difference in my skin. This includes many highly reviewed products. But this, along with Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Power-Cream Wash (which I also buy for a great price on Amazon too) are the only two things I can remember using that made a noticeable difference in my skin.		So you know, I have rosacea, and had shiny, red, sometimes flushed and burning cheeks. I tried many things until I finally settled on this regimen and it has improved my skin greatly. It has more of a matte look instead of that shiny, red irritated look. I use the clarisonic Mia with the DELICATE brush. I ran out of it once and used the gentle brush that came with the Mia and saw and felt a definite difference. It was too rough on my skin and left it red and abused feeling. I use it with the Neutrogena product I mentioned in the first paragraph. (I was using the Neutrogena grapefruit wash before and that was NOT good. Left me very red.) Then I use this moisturizer. I used to use the same one in the daytime version, but that one would go on streaky and then crumble when I tried to wipe away the streaks. Also it looked kinda shiny and I didn't like the way my skin looked with it on. The night version has none of those problems. I wear it day or night and when I put it on in bed without a mirror, if I get up to go the bathroom or something, when I look in the mirror I see no streaks. That was not the case with the daytime version which I used to use at night. I woke up in the morning with all kinds of crazy streaks. Also, I love the smell and feel of it while it's going on. It feels a little cool which is just what my rosacea skin needs. You might not notice the cool feeling, but if you have rosacea then you definitely appreciate a cream that's cool rather than warm when going on. Also, it's hard to explain, but it makes my skin look really nice and glowing-like. Other reviewers have probably explained it better than me and all I can say is it's true!		One more thing that I feel I should mention, though with many reservations and ""buts"", is the Tanda Luxe. I bought one around the same time I adopted this skin care routine. I think it has also made a difference in my skin as far as the shinyness from rosacea but it also leaves my skin pleasantly flushed when I finish using it which might not be a good thing for Rosacea, but I'm unsure. Another reservation I have in recommending this is that all the reviews that complain about its battery are completely true. I have to charge it after every two times I use it. And lately it's gotten even worse.		Those of you reading this that have rosacea, you should know that the products I use have ingredients that are not recommended for people with rosacea, but it works for me and my moderate rosacea. It might not work for you, and I guess we all have to find what works for us and our type of rosacea. I hope I've been helpful and wish you all the best!"

To be honest, I'm a little lazy when it comes to my skin care regime, and this is so easy. I apply it at night and when I wake up and have consistently clear skin. Besides soap and water, this is the only thing I do to my skin. I have combo. skin and have noticed that my t-zone is a little dryer after a prolonged use of this product, but I'm not complaining. I also have sensitive skin (for that reason, I can't use benzoyl peroxide, the other common acne treatment), but do not have a problem using this product. And for whatever reason, even though the active ingredient concentration may be the same, Clean and Clear is the best version of this product I've tried.

My main reason for choosing this was because it didn't have benzoyl peroxide in it. I LOVE it! It smells wonderful and it makes me happy just applying it. I haven't noticed any abnormal dryness, but that's probably because I put a lotion over my entire face, including the spots I treated with this product. It goes on really smooth, it hasn't reacted in a bad way with any of my other lotions and in a short period of time it has already appeared to make my ance less red."

It usually gradually shrinks the pimple then makes it disappear (in 2 or 3 days), sometimes it just shrinks it.. and sometimes it doesn't do anything at all. After getting a couple of pimples that simply REFUSED to disappear after 5-7 days of applying the product, I decided to try out another product (Neutrogena on the spot treatment), I have yet to see if it will work. All in all, this thing definitely works most of the time. Though its transparent, people can see a ""shine"" coming from where it is applied.

After many weeks the mushy part subsided but I was left with this big dark spot that stayed on my face for MONTHS. I had to always cover it up. Even after a couple of years I still have a light scar from it.		Anyway, that was just my experience. I am sure it probably does work for some people though that's why I decided to give it 2 stars instead of 1.

I started doing everything from washing my face often to using acne soaps and creams from my local beauty store to some home remedies I had heard about etc, but nothing worked.  I was even thinking about ordering one of those fancy-ad products (you know the one I'm talking about) until I read somewhere that it is not the best product for African American Skin. A friend of mine then told me the wonders that Clean & Clear did for her acne and post acne marks (dark spot remover) and so, I decided to try this one after doing some research.		Even after what my friend had told me and reading all of the great reviews about this product, I was still a bit skeptical because... Well, how many of us trust products that claim to work this fast???  But, I decided that I had nothing to lose and ordered it on Amazon.com. After placing my order, I read some more reviews and then became a little impatient waiting for it to arrive in the mail (told you I was desperate). So, I went to Walmart and bought the same one for about the same price and I tried it the same day.		I first applied it on the problem areas on my face at about 9AM that day, washed it off after 30 minutes and reapplied it. I did this three times that day, left the last batch on my face and went to sleep (I work overnight). I kid you not, when I woke up around 8PM that night, I had already started seeing results. My acne started dissolving that same day.		It has now been 6 days since I've been using this product and my acne is almost completely gone.

B00027DDOQ,2011,3,1.0,9,12,87,"Doesn't live up to its claims","I usually get a few of those big, red pimples around my period or when I'm super stressed out, and I decided to try this out. It did absolutely nothing but make my skin burn for a few seconds, and the skin around the pimples got dry and flaky. I have had a pimple on my chin for a week and have been using this product as recommended - clearly, the pimple is just doing this own thing and I am rubbing clear...stuff...on it just for kicks."
B00027DDOQ,2012,0,5.0,2,2,79,"Great spot treatment, but has stopped working :(","I have been using this spot treatment for YEARS and it is the best one I have ever come across. I put it on every pimple I got and it reduced the size and appearance of every single one. Unfortunately, it seems to stop working on me now that I have been using it for so long. Sad, now I have to find another spot treatment.. I would highly recommend it though to those who have not tried it!"
B00027DDOQ,2012,5,5.0,1,1,481,"Works Every Time","I apologize that this is not an 'Amazon Verified Purchase' as I usually look for that when reading reviews to make sure they're legit.  Even though I have not bought it through Amazon yet, I wanted to review this product because it's a staple in my hygiene regimen and my first and best defense against acne.  In other words, when my face wash and special moisturizer routine is not enough and a pimple or two pop up, I swear by this product to keep my skin clear and healthy!		Background: My skin is normal to dry, and I break out mostly in the T zone (forehead, either side of my nose/cheeks, and chin).  Since I am in my 20s now my skin is a lot better than it used to be, but I still get a few annoying pimples of varying sizes at least once a month.		For some reason, my skin loves Salicylic Acid, and this product packs the perfect amount to obliterate my acne every time no matter if it's on my face or a rogue one on my body.  The tube is easy to squeeze and the gel is actually clear on the skin, but comes out thick and translucent whitish grey in color.  It does not have a smell that I can recall (certainly nothing unpleasant).  Absorbs into my skin within 30 seconds of application and leaves no residue.  Can apply under makeup, sunscreen, multiple times a day.  Most of the time I apply it to prevent any acne from surfacing.		Every time I feel or see that I am about to breakout in any area on my face, or have found a pimple on my body, I apply a little bit of this and make sure to rub it in.  If it's just one pimple, I apply a generous amount to it, sometimes breaking the skin slightly to let out any pus before applying it, and it barely stings at all (I find that it works faster that way, but it's not necessary).  There's hardly any scabbing after applying this product: the acne simply shrinks, redness decreases, skin goes back to normal.  It also works for me on larger patches when I smooth it on in a thin layer.		I would describe it as the perfect acne product, and recommend it to acne sufferers all of the time.  I have never ever suffered from dryness in the areas I've applied it to, even if I apply it multiple times a day.  It never fails to demolish the blemishes completely, without any type of skin damage, within a day or two (I can see improvement as early as a few hours or overnight).  It leaves my skin feeling amazing and I get compliments on my face.  This is to give credit where credit is due: to my favorite acne zapper, Clean & Clear Advantage acne spot treatment."
B00027DDOQ,2012,0,5.0,0,0,79,"Works great and works FAST","I normally don't like acne medications - they dry out your skin and then your face is a flaky mess.  With this stuff, you just apply a little dab to each pimple and it starts to work within 24 hrs - no flaking or irritation.  For a small pimple, applying it once a day is plenty; for something more severe, I usually apply 2-3 times per day.  Either way, the pimple completely clears up within a few days (hurray!)."

I have some wrinkle lines between my eyes from squinting, and concentrating on my computer screen.  I feel like with a few uses this has made the skin look firmer.

The only downside was that it was a little hard to clean off; I had to use my toner afterwards to get rid of all of it, and I didn't see any real reduction in the size of my pores (you can't actually reduce pore size, but if they are very clogged they'll look bigger). It's very smooth compared to other clay masks I've tried, and goes on quite thick so you don't need very much of it. It also will pull any pimples that are forming to the surface, so it might look like you're breaking out; actually, it's just speeding the process along, and if you're using a good topical treatment they should heal faster. (I would personally recommend the Clean & Clear Persa-Gel and the Popped Pimple Relief Gel Pen; the Persa-Gel really helps to speed up the healing process and the Popped Pimple Relief Gel reduces redness and any pain you might suffer from pimples around the nose or lips.)		With that being said, it took a very long time to ship and it looked like the tube had been squashed a few times in-transit; might have been a better idea to use a box instead of a shipping bag.

B00008CMOS,2011,0,4.0,7,8,130,"worth a try","I like this product, it clears your skin even after the first use. Well, all I have discovered so far regarding skin care is that if you have a oily or mixed-type of skin, you have to watch your diet, stay away from greasy food, eat lots of veggies and fruits, drink lots of green tea after meals to detoxify your body, and exercise regularly. In addition to this life style, if you use this product, you will certainly receive good results. But by itself, it is not going to make miracles. It is good to get rid of excess sebum on face, which is important to prevent black or white heads. It also dries up the pimples quickly. But I recommend it in tandem with a healthy life :)"
B00008CMOS,2011,4,1.0,14,18,198,"It made me break out!","Considering the stellar reviews this product garnered, I expected decent results. The smell is refreshing, the application smooth and easy, I even liked the calming green color. That's the extent of my praise. This mask made me break out the first time I used it. Attributing the breakout to other factors (genes, hormones, or stress), I decided to undertake a second trial. I broke out again. What I gleaned from others' reviews is this isn't one of those remedies that make your skin ""worse before it gets better""--an inept advertisement that I don't believe in. Out of 70+ reviews, I am the only one who broke out. So you could risk your chances, I just wanted to alert prospective buyers of the possibility of your skin exacerbating. If you are in the market for an effective mask, may I suggest Glycone Acne Facial Masque--I'm already on my second tub. It clears your pores, dries up zits, and improves your complexion, just make sure to moisturize afterwards.		I never write reviews for products, but I realized the importance of publicizing your experience (bad or good) so that future customers can make an informed decision.

B00008CMOS,2012,4,5.0,4,4,527,"Great mask for troubled skin!!!","I'm a 28 year old male and I have suffered from Acne from since I can remember. I've tried it all, if you can name I have probably tried it. With that said because I have tried it all and researched things from what causes Acne and oily skin to the treatments I somewhat have become a semi-expert on oily acne prone skin which I suffer from. When I came across this product I noticed all the positive reviews so I decided to give it a try and it has worked wonders for me. It has reduced my oily skin, shrunken my pores and reduced any ingrown hairs or blemishes I had. I noticed people complained that it doesn't help rid their Acne and I feel the reason for this is that the mask contains Sulfur which helps with oily skin, inflammation and large pores. Also I feel with any kind of wash or facial treatment the key for it to work is to exfoliate. To exfoliate with simply a scrub or if thats not working you can buy a exfoliator brush. Let me please stress this first! For people with Acne prone skin this product will not help treat your Acne on its own! The only two treatments for Acne is either Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid. The mask helps alleviate Acne when used in conjunction with the two treatments I mentioned previously. To rid yourself of Acne you need a daily regimen I can't stress that more! To help I will share mine. I have the following products:		1. Daily exfoliator skin scrub which contains Salicylic Acid	2. Daily Wash which contains Benzoyl Peroxide	3. Exfoliating facial brush	4. Queen Helene Masque Mint Julep(jar) contains Bentonite and Sulfur	5. Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads contains Salicylic Acid	6. Moisturizer	7. Acne skin treatment contains 10% Benzoyl Peroxide		Every night before I shower I first wash my skin with the daily scrub wash, dry my skin then shave. After I'm done shaving to prevent ingrown hairs and get rid of the dead skin cells left over after using the scrub I first apply moisturizer on my skin then scrub my skin for about five minutes with the facial brush, wash my skin with warm water to open up my pores then I dry my skin and afterwards apply the Queen Helene mask. After about 30 minutes to an hour I then wash it off with my daily wash which contains the Benzoyl Peroxide. I lastly apply the Acne skin treatment. In the morning I just use the daily skin scrub, dry my skin then apply the Daily Action pads afterwards and throughout the day. Ever since I started this regimen I've been Acne free. I can miss a day or two but anything more than that my skin slowly starts acting up again. Not everyone is the same but maybe sharing my daily regimen may help someone with their skin problems. Just remember no one product will help with your Acne problems you need to have a daily regimen of things which help to keep your skin clear and Acne free. I hope I've helped everyone!"

It worked pretty well at reducing their size and making my skin feel tight and fresh. I would recommend you purchase this at Walgreens because it is only $3.99"
B00008CMOS,2011,8,5.0,4,4,268,Wonderful.,"This is a wonderful product.  Yes, it is a bit thick, kind of like toothpaste.  Yes, it does smell minty, also a lot like toothpaste.  But don't be mistaken.  This is no toothpaste.  While you might be inclined to use a thicker layer the first time, don't.  It will take forever to dry and a thinner layer will do just as good of a job.  Let it sit until it dries.  I wouldn't leave it on overnight or for hours and hours, but it definitely needs to dry.  Once the mask is dry simply rinse, don't scrub, it off.  Showering after using this mask will probably be easier than trying to rinse it off in the sink).  Your skin will feel cleaner and healthier.  It will also feel (and look!) prettier.  You should probably know that this product will bleach your eyebrows, so don't get any on them.  You should also probably plan to use a moisturizer afterwords--I'm a fan of Vitamin E Oil, usually made with vitamin e and soybean oil.  It's a natural moisturizer and helps even your skin tone.  This mask will do a lot for your skin but it's not a miracle worker--it took away probably 2/3rds of the blackheads on my nose after 1 use (and there were a LOT of them), evened my skin tone, slightly cleared up a minor pimple, and generally tightened my skin.  It did NOT remove all of my blackheads or magically get rid of that pimple.  It is, after all, a mask and not a miracle. And as a mask, it is very much worth your time."

Update: This is the third week of using this product (7 times total so far), my pores have decreased in size (noticeable, but not significantly) and not a lot of acne (if any) is showing up on my face.		Conclusion: I would say for such an inexpensive product, it works really well (on my face at least). There is about a 10-20 second stinging when I put the product on, probably because there is a lot of cracks in my skin and dryness from walking outside in the cold. After that, it feels really refreshing to have on. Of course this product isn't for everyone because everyone have different type of skin, but so far so good for me. Have patience when trying this out for the first time, it does have a deep clean so you may have excess acne using it for the first couple of weeks.

My makeup went on so smoothly.  Now that I am beginning to show more signs of aging I use it when I want to see my wrinkles smooth out for at least part of a day.  It just feels so fresh after it comes off and you feel like your face just woke up, it gives a nice clear look.

I think it's kind of medicinal. It is a thicker, clay type of drying mask so you must wait till it dries until you wash it off with warm water and a wash cloth.

The pimples & blackheads on my face were becoming relentless and were quite painful. The first time I used this masque, I saw immediate changes. The blackheads on my nose were significantly smaller than they were when I put the masque on, the pimples around my mouth, under my chin, and on my forehead weren't nearly as inflamed and angry as they had been, and my skin felt soft & clean. Here are a few more important things:		-This product works much better when acting as a supplement to a skincare system. I quite like Clinique's 3-Step system as a regular routine and use this product as an additive for a boost.		-IT. WILL. BURN. when you put it on. I have pretty sensitive skin, so if you're someone who isn't bothered by mint, it probably won't be nearly as painful for you. But, if you're like me and have ""tender skin"", prepare yourself. It's not unbearable, but it is pretty intense for the first few minutes and subsides as the masque dries.		-This is GREAT as an overnight spot treatment. I can't count the number of times I've left it sitting on an angry pimple or nasty cystic pimple over night to find that they are significantly better in the morning.		This is something that I keep coming back to, time and time again. It's not too harsh, it's not stinky, and it works. The best part? It's inexpensive ($2.47 at WalMary/CVS)."

I have chronic blackheads that NEVER go away and some pretty large pores, everything I've ever tried hasn't been able to get rid of them, so I thought this would help with pore minimizing or clearing blackheads. I've been using this at least weekly, sometimes more, and there hasn't been any noticeable improvement in my blackheads or pores, even immediately after using it. It does smell nice and it sucks up quite a bit of oil from my face so it does have some benefits, but not enough to keep buying it. I'll have to keep searching for a solution for my face!"
B00008CMOS,2011,7,2.0,1,1,347,"feels nice but made me breakout","This seems to be a really popular mask, firstly.  However, I can actually get it cheaper from my local drugstore, but the nice thing about amazon is you get other people's reviews before just boldly trying new things (on your face no less!), so I got it here.  I've had this for quite a while now, and don't use it often.		When I use it, it smells and feels great.  Let me tell you, I've never used any other mask but this is great while on.  And, I have really acne-prone skin and getting desperate to get rid of this acne already, so I'll try anything that seems to have even a hope of working... When it is drying, I can actually see where my pores are... seems like they're emptying because there are lots of little dots where my pores are... like those are just tiny moist spots from the oil in my skin getting sucked into the mask.  At least, that's what it seems like.  I always finish washing it up as happy as a clam because it seems so much like it is great for my skin and acne.		However, I've had this experience several times now, and EVERY TIME I break out immediately afterwards.  I did it a few days ago again, and didn't change anything else in the skin routine... Major breakout!  I think I always swear not to use it again after this happens, but don't actually throw it out, because it feels so good and makes me think its working... then after I've forgotten about the breakout, I re-use it again and repeat the whole process.  Maybe I should give up and throw it away... You could try to argue that the breakout might be a result of extracting all that oil or something, but my skin just returns to its normal state after the breakout seems to have fizzled off... no long term type effect.		Maybe this works for some, but definitely doesn't for me :(  Trust me, I wish it did work as it seems to for others."
B00008CMOS,2011,4,5.0,1,1,136,"AMAZING! Shrunk pores to nearly invisible","I have been using this mask for a week. The results have been so impressive that I've been using it at least once per day and sometimes 2. My pores were not huge but they definitely made my skin look older. I can't believe it, the pores on my cheeks are almost completely gone. On top of that even the redness around my nose where I have broken capillaries looks much clearer. It has removed blackheads around my nose that I didn't realize were even there. My entire face looks better and discolorations have diminished. I feel like I've taken a couple years off my face in one week. It's amazing such a fantastic product is so reasonably priced. I will continue to use the product indefinitely. I highly recommend it to anyone with oily skin."
B00008CMOS,2011,3,3.0,1,1,22,"too dry after using","My face becomes so dry after washing the mask away. So I think it is not for thin skin for sensitive skin."
B00008CMOS,2011,3,5.0,1,1,69,"Great Product! I recommend it!","I had first used the grapefruit extract peel-off and I fell in love with it. Then I tried this one on and I thought it was great. It does have a toothpaste'y feeling but it works amazing. The longer you keep it on the better your skin feels afterwards. It leaves your skin feeling fresh, clean and it even makes your face look brighter. I really recomment using this!"
B00008CMOS,2011,3,4.0,1,1,140,"I got my money's worth","I have oily skin, A LOT OF blackheads, and huge pores. Well, I can say that it's improved my skin, but this product on my face didn't improve so much my acne scars, I noticed my pores just a little smaller, and it didn't scrub off a lot of blackheads as others said. But, as I said, I have too many blackheads and huge pores with acne scars, I guess my case is more difficult and complicated. Anyways, on the whole my skin is better: less oily, firmer, with better appearance. I'm using every day after cleansing my face, and the price is wonderful, better than a lot of dollars spent on Proactive, Neutrogena, Acnefree, etc ...	It came on time in an envelope. But next time I'm going to buy at Walgreens, they have it a lot and cheaper."
B00008CMOS,2011,3,5.0,1,1,72,"27 year old MAN","I was skeptical of yet another blackhead eraser miracle product, but I am completely impressed.  I've tried.the biore crap strips that do absolutely nothing, as well as lots of other promising products and this is the one that works.  Diminished blackheads and smaller pores after a few consistent applications.  Apply a layer thick enough to cover, let dry, rinse off in 20-30 min. Great product and delivered way before estimated delivery date."
B00008CMOS,2010,11,5.0,4,4,52,"Work as it should!","I enjoy using this once or twice for my facial and love it! It's recommend if  you need some pamper and don't judge it's prices. It's smell nice and turn harden as I leave it on for awhile then wash it out, result in smooth, simple nice smell on my skin. =)"
B00008CMOS,2010,9,5.0,4,4,316,Geez,"I've bought all kinds of products looking for something to help my acne prone skin.  It's hard to believe this gem was hiding right up the street for literally a fraction of the price I've paid for less effective products.		I bought this after reading the reviews here.  I knew something good was happening as soon as I put it on.  It tingles in a pleasant way and you can actually feel it working.  It took about 30 minutes to dry completely.  I rinsed it off and my face feels CLEAN. There's no other word to describe it.  It really feels like my pores are breathing a sigh of relief.  I don't know that my face has ever felt this unclogged.  A lot of the gunk in my pores and on the surface of my skin has been sucked up and rinsed off.  My skin feels smooth and soft.  It is a little dry and tight, but I know my skin will eventually adjust to that and the dryness will lessen after a few uses.		It's a little tough to rinse this stuff off because it's thick and clings a bit.  I recommend using it before you shower.  That'll be the fastest and easiest way to get it off.		The smell is also quite strong and minty.  Some people will be turned off and/or simply unable to stand it.  I started getting a headache after a while from the smell, but it was well worth suffering through.  (At least it's not as bad as Mario Badescu drying mask, which smells like tires.  I actually had to shove balls of tissue up my nostrils with that one.)		All in all, read the reviews and believe them.  I hope the effects continue and that it doesn't stop working after a while.  We'll see.  I'm already looking at other Queen Helene products, which you'll notice also have stellar reviews."
B00008CMOS,2010,5,5.0,4,4,189,"Clearer skin, smaller pores, EVEN SKIN TONE!","I am 23.  I never had acne until recently due to a hormonal disorder.  I now have a small amount of scarring (red & slightly pocked) on one side of my face.  My friend gave me a bottle of this & WOW!  It is so wonderful.  I use it every few days & my skin just glows.		My skin type:  oily T-zone yet dry with medium sized pores.  This does NOT dry out my skin at all & it reduces the oil as well as the size of my pores.  It also really helps clear pimples as well as pimples that are already dried out/ flaky- it REALLY speeds the healing process.		Of course everyone has a different skin types but I think I have found a product that I will use FOR LIFE. I have tried all sorts of produts- Neutrogena, Aveeno, Clean & Clear, L'Oreal, LANCOME, Arbonne, Mary Kay, Clinique & more. This is by far my favorite of everything I have tried, even over the ones that I already loved.		Thanks to this I have clear skin, smaller pores & a MUCH more even skin tone!"
B00008CMOS,2011,11,5.0,3,3,245,"It's a Miracle!","I bought the Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque after I couldn't find my St. Ives clay masque anymore.  Since this product had good reviews, I thought I would give it a try.  Well, I wish I had found this years ago!  My skin has never looked so good!		At 26 years old, I still have issues with breakouts, even when I am extremely diligent about my skin care.  I started using this masque several (3-4) times per week for the last two weeks, and I have not had any more acne pop up, and in fact, my chin (which is my main ""problem area"") looks so much better!  The bumps are gone, skin is smoother, pores are smaller, and since I'm not getting any new breakouts, my old acne scars are beginning to fade!		At the same time I ordered this masque, I also ordered Burts Bees Repair Serum.  So, after I wash the masque off, I put a dab of my St. Ives Collagen moisturizer in my hand, several drops of the Burt's Bees repari serum and about 5-6 drops of tea tree oil, rub it all together and slather it on my skin.  I think I've finally found a skin care routine that works!  My skin is clear, my pores are smaller, and my skin is so soft and smooth!		I'm so pleased with this product and I would recommend that anyone with troubled skin try this.  I think you will be amazed!"
B00008CMOS,2011,11,5.0,3,3,226,"The burning means it's working.","Well, I used it for the first time today and it BURNED my skin, but as they say, the burning means it's working! To many people, breaking out when using this product is COMMON. In almost any acne treatment, usually because the dirt in your skin is being cleaned out but still is in your skin, but this masque is helping it. The first step to this is actually making you break out, then it will start working.		I'll keep you guys updated on what happens within the next week or so, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. But so far, I think it was a good thing to get. And for the price it's not really a dent in your budget, so why not worth a shot right? :)  But the burning is some-what unbearable for the first few minutes, but then it becomes soothing and feels like you're skins being cleaned. :)		----UPDATE----Now I give it 5 stars!	Oh, how I LOVE this mask! It absolutely did give me smaller pores, and helped clear up all these annoying pimples around my face. I mostly get them around my chin and this mask took it all away! My Fiancee also used this, he has dry sensitive skin, and used this and in 1 week it cleared up. I love this mask. :)"
B00008CMOS,2009,5,5.0,3,3,52,"Super cheap but works really well.","I bought this for my wife, at her request, and she loved it.  I gave it a try and this product literally prevented breakouts and my skin felt much better.  It's crazy to think that a 3 dollar product can work so well when there are so many other more expensive alternatives."
B00008CMOS,2009,1,5.0,3,3,109,"Cool! (and minty)","I was a little skeptical when I read all of the great reviews for this product, but I decided to try it anyway. Lucky me! It did pretty much everything the product advertised, and it didn't over dry my combination/oily skin, even when I used it several nights in a row. Something that I thought was really exciting was that I could actually see all the oil that this masque sucked out of my pores! The only difficulty I had with this product was that it's really thick and a little bit hard to get out of the tube, but it didn't really bother me that much. Definitely recommended!"
B00008CMOS,2009,0,4.0,3,3,46,"Good lifting mask","This mask tightens my skin better than any other I've tried(keep in mind though, that I'm still young.. so it may not do wonders for older skin).  Queen Helene's Mint Julep mask is much better for acne, and clearing clogged pores, but still a great product."
B00008CMOS,2009,0,5.0,3,3,125,Wonderful!,"I have used this for years!! It always comes through with making my pores seem smaller, helps my pimples dry out, and just feeling refreshed.	If you have stubborn pimples, it works, you just have to use it every night on just the pimples, not your whole face.	And if you have a black head problem, once a week 15 minute mask works really well too.	Nothing is a magic cure, you just have to work with the product. And this one is cheap, works, and lasts a long time.	I've only had to buy two 8 oz tubes in the last 15 years.	I suggest it to all my friends and any teenagers I run across that ask how I keep a nice complexion."
B00008CMOS,2008,2,5.0,3,3,122,"Great for enlarged pores and acne","This stuff is better than proactiv and clean and clear advance, i know i've tried them all.  This is the only one that shrinks your pores and pimples, smooths out your skin and actually works right away.  The others don't and they cost waaaaayyyy more. It works so good it's mind blowing. Anyone with acne should try this product, it's fast , affordable and won't leave you with chemical burns on your face.. You can even sleep in it. It  also prevents pimples by keeping your pores clean.  And you don't  have to use it, everyday or  with several other products in a complicated  beauty routine, to get the full benifits of it.

I mainly use it to dry out acne which it does a fair job at. It is also rather relaxing. There is no burning or irritation for me when I use it. The smell when it is applied is, as expected, minty but when it is rinsed off a stil minty but slightly unpleasant smell lingers but is not there long enough to bother me. Definitely try to keep this out of your hair. It's easy to get out but if you don't see it, it will dry and stay there all day.		I prefer this to the CVS knockoff brand because I occasionally feel a slight stinging with that so I would recommend this over the CVS brand, especially if you have sensitive skin."

I have dry skin so I worried it would make it worse but this mask leaves my skin so smooth that a touch of light moisturizer after is all I really need. My face feels is acne prone, especially at my jaw line. After washing off this mask, my acne is much smoother and less visible and clears up much faster. I do it 2-3 times a week and I don't have to exfoliate nearly as much. Once a week if that. I'm repurchasing this one very soon and I will probably try the others by this brand as well. On a side note, I wouldn't leave this on overnight like others have. For me, I woke up in the middle of the night to itchy skin and a crumbly mask. Once I washed it off and moisturized I was fine again. Buy this mask! You won't regret it!"

I've been going to the dermatologist for the past 14 months and by now you would have thought I'd be 100% acne free. I've been on various pills, washes, and even diets hoping to get rid of this unwanted burden. The biggest problem I had was finding a product that eliminated the acne and kept my skin moisturized. Many products would dry my skin out which caused it to crack and hurt more than it did prior! The Queen Helene Masque keeps my face moisturized and makes my pores smaller. I tend to keep the masque on a little longer than suggested because after it hardens I find it easier to wash off. You sense a difference immediately! It feels like your face is buried in a pile of silk. I use a total of 3 different products, which together seem to work terrific. I've been taking <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LJ0ZK6"">ClearZine (2 Bottles) - The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill. Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits</a> for about 3 months which does an awesome job of clearing acne and preventing breakouts. It's the only over the counter product I found that works as good if not better than most prescribed acne treatment. I also use Proactiv face wash daily for 5 months now. Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque along with these 2 other products have been a savior. They have given me the best results I have seen to date and I believe that without all 3 I'd still be dealing with terrible black heads and the occasional cyst.

I usually add a drop of lavender or peppermint essential oil to the masque which turns it into my own private spa treatment. The lavender calms while the peppermint refreshes.

I have moderate acne and combination skin, and this mask is perfect for both spot treatments and a weekly facial mask. I put it on after a steamy shower when my pores are more open, and then let it dry for 20 minutes. It has a bit of an odd smell, but that is from the sulfur in it, which is a natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal - so it is the perfect treatment for acne causing bacteria in your pores. After 20 minutes if I look in the mirror, I can actually see where the mask has penetrated deep into my pores and sucked out excess oils and stuff. It leaves my face smooth and clean, and isn't overly drying like some other facial products can be. Since I started using this mask, my pores are smaller and I have a lot less breakouts. When I do get a pimple, I dab some of this on the spot before bed, and after 1 or 2 days the pimple is flat. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an easy treatment for acne."

I have combo skin and I am 25, but now that I live in a humid climate... it gets oily quickly then what I'm used too. I use this mask once or twice a week. It's cheap and works better than some of the expensive masks I've wasted money on, plus you can buy it in most places where you also get your groceries. I will never stop using this.

It's economical as well, cheaper than other masks that don't work nearly as well.

It states that it will absorb excess oil, rinse away blackheads and helps minimize appearance of pores. As for the absorbing excess oil, it absolutely does that! After applying this for the first time, I went back onto my computer and waited for it to dry. When going back into the bathroom to take it off, I noticed that the mask took out oil from each one of my pores. You could actually see the little dots of the what it took out. Also, my blackheads which I have mostly on my nose and chin, were diminished by 80%! I was shocked to see that they were almost unnoticeable unless you were extremely close! Those suckers almost never go away for me, but now they are finally almost gone and only after one use!! Also, being blessed with big pores is also annoying. They were trapped with gunk inside and it was hard to get all of it out. After removing the mask the pores are almost invisible! I was shocked...and they were cleaned out! My skin looks more even, and just overall more healthy. Can I also tell you again that this is after ONE use? Incredible. Also, any active breakouts that I had before putting this on, are also almost gone, and I haven't had any new breakouts. This stuff is, excuse my language...the shit! Love this stuff, please go try it out!!"

However after removing it, tone (if needed) and moisturize (if necessary) I have recognize it can be somewhat drying, but it's not too bad, in my opinion.  Still the best mask I use for breakouts."

It stung just the slightest bit going on, but that was actually reassuring to me, in that I felt that there must be something to the product :)		The scent was refreshing.  The color is a palish green, and the texture is like a very thick cream or paste.		The packaging said to ""apply generously"" and then wait 15 minutes.  I applied an opaque layer over my face, but it took at least 30 minutes before it was really dry.		When I washed the masque off, the pores on my nose were practically gone.  Which was amazing!  I was very pleased with this product for that reason alone.  Immediate visible improvement.		The product didn't feel too drying.  I'm guessing I'll get 6-7 applications out of one tube.  I would definitely purchase this product again.		update:  I'll probably get 9-10 applications from one tube.  It's more than I thought!  Also, I've been using almost every day, and the improvement in my complexion is very noticeable!  It's not just my pores.  My entire face is evened out and brighter.

Wash your face with water as hot as you can stand it for a while, or try steaming it, then slap some of this stuff on nice and thick overnight; it's incredible.  It will dry your skin; just put a bit of oil-free skin lotion on your face after you wash it off, and be sure that the face wash you use isn't abrasive ( I use Nivea's moisturizing cream face wash, the white stuff with the orange beads..)  If you have red irritating pimples, you'll notice a change overnight; and if you use it every night, your skin will rock.  The cool thing is, this stuff also shrinks and minimizes the little pocks that zits leave in your face; I used to have them really bad under my eyes, they're almost nonexistant now.  Wal-Mart sells this stuff, if you were wondering. (Usually, anyway.)"
B00008CMOS,2010,4,5.0,30,30,304,"LOVE IT!","This is one of the only beauty products I've ever found that ACTUALLY DOES WHAT IT CLAIMS TO DO.  It removes oil and blackheads like nothing else, and HOLY COW, IT ACTUALLY DOES SHRINK HUGE PORES!		I am ""blessed"" with really large pores -- enormous might be a better word, and I've always felt self-conscious about them.  Whenever I'm going to go out, though, I apply the mint julep masque and give it plenty of time to thoroughly dry.  I've been using it regularly for about a year and I am still thrilled to see how tight it makes my pores, and how smooth it makes my skin appear.  Of course the effect is not permanent -- I've found that it lasts for about six to eight hours.  I can extend the shrunken-pore look by a few hours by frequently blotting my face with blotting papers.		My skin is extremely oily -- you don't even want to know how oily.  As a result, I've always had acne that is impossible to control.  I'm 30 now, and have struggled badly with acne since my early teens.  This product has significantly improved my acne situation, primarily by helping to extract blackheads -- it never quite gets all of them, but it definitely removes a significant amount.  The rest I am able to get out by manually extracting them.  Plus, the way it sucks up oil -- oh my gosh, it's amazing.		I use it three or four times per week, but in the past during really bad skin times I've used it as often as twice per day.  It is a great product.  I use it along with daily niacin and zinc supplements, Cetaphil cleanser, and daily use of a 10% glycolic acid lotion to finally, finally achieve great, healthy, ALMOST-clear skin.  I love this product!"

Additionally, there was no way that I was going to use a mask... I always thought it was a girl thing. Well, I was wrong. Recently my girlfriend had me try a mask that came with proactive and it seemed do help with my pimples a little bit. So, out of curiosity one day I picked up this Mint Julep mask because it has mostly natural products rather than all the drying agents most acne products use like salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide. I also used a product called Principal Secret: blemish buster solution which contains sulfur which is excellent at getting rid of zits. Unfortunately this spot treatment of sulfur is almost 30 dollars for a .5oz bottle. To my surprise, the mint julep mask contains sulfur and can be used as a spot treatment as well. I use the mask once a week, and wash my face once everyday with St. Ives apricot scrub (without salicylic acid) and have seen amazing results. I have had really great results with this mask and my zits have disappeared completely. Every once and a while I will have one start to pop up, but I use the apricot scrub to open the pores then follow with a dab of this (leave on overnight) and do my weekly one application per week routine and the result is great. My girlfriend no longer gives me a hard time about zits, and I am more confident because I have a clean professional looking face. I highly recommend this product."

After I washed my face, I was almost gonna cry as my face become very smooth. This mud masque even cleared some blackheads. I thought only the Mint Julep masque and the other peel off mask by QH  does that. I am very happy  about this product and now planning to buy the big jar so it can last longer. If I had known about Queen Helen products in my teens,then I would start using them right after I had my very first breakouts.

B00008CMOS,2012,0,4.0,11,12,294,"Minty and refreshing, but...","I waited an entire month to finally post my review for this face masque. I bought it because of all the positive reviews.	Immediately, I was impressed by the smell. I know some people don't like it, but the minty smell was something I wasn't used to for a facial masque.  Before I tell you how well the product worked, I must first tell you, that I have the most difficult to tame acne a person could have. Doctors' prescriptions, and various attempts to cure it has all been for naught. I HAVE tried everything possible.		I used the masque as specified once a night for an entire month, and here is what I have to say about the results.		The mask is like any other mask, but after washing it off, your face feels super refreshed. I figured I'd see some awesome results because it made me feel awesome, or even just smaller pores..but I wasn't so lucky. My acne had not decreased, nor did my pores shrink anywhere on my face. The only benefit I achieved from a month of using the masque, was healthier feeling skin. The problem is my skin is still plagues with acne, and this masque is supposed to reduce it.	I can't be super harsh on it, because I'm a special case, and I'm sure people with average acne love this product, but it is not any more powerful than other products around.		Pros	Minty Smell	Improved Skin Health		Con	Not Effective against severe acne		UPDATE*		After months of treatment with solodyn pills and retin-a, I've improved dramatically. If your acne is really bad go to a dermatologist and have these prescribed. This facial masque is nice and all, but it is no substitute for medical treatment."
B00008CMOS,2005,2,5.0,14,16,266,"A wonderful product","This product is very good. To start off it's very easy to put on. The product may sting or tingle for a minute or so, but that's typical of any mask like this one, it's just cleaning everything off that you coulden't get with the cleanser or scrub. While the product is drying, it gets into the pores especially around the nose where blackheads are, and you can see it. If this were a peel-off mask, it would probably gently peel off all of your blackheads. It smoothes the area around the nose and actually treats the blackheads. The stuff inside the acne is actually sucked out and removed when washed off. Since this product does not have eucaliptus, it will not overdry your face which is very good. I reccomend using this product once a week. Here's a good order to use to clean your skin with:		  1. Cleanse- with any typical cleanser. (I reccomend an invigorating cleanser that you can feel working and opening pores to prepare for the scrub.)		  2. Scrub- with any typical scrub (You could use a scrub with a cleanser for extra cleansing if your face is not too dry.)		  3. Mask- with this superb mask or any other of your choice.		  4. Tone- with any typical toner, I reccomend a more gentle toner like the ""L'oreal Hydrafresh Toner"" just to soften up skin and prepare for soft moisturizer.		  5. Moisturize- with any typical moisturizer.		  All in all this mask is very good and does what it says. It is the original formula, so it's very good for your face."

Just finished putting it on my skin now in fact...my skin feels velvety smooth, quite honestly. Best applied after a shower where the steam has opened up your pores, plus applying a good exfoliator, then it will really work it's magic. A bit hard to remove after applied, but it's no problem with using lukewarm-hot water to wash off, great removal with a face towel. Love the cheap price as well... And the tingly sensation when you put it on feels like it's working. Won't regret buying it =]"

This stuff really works at drying up pimples and zits.  I'm also 18 and have had really bad acne for years.  This other prescription junk kinda works, but not without drying out my skin, tightening it like a vice, and making my skin red, sensitive, and sunburn prone.

B00008CMOS,2012,1,3.0,3,4,299,"Good for when you want your skin to look just a bit better","I love clay masks. This one is affordable and contains bentonite, which in this day in age is important for one reason: radiation. We clever humans are bombarded on a daily basis by radiation by computers and cell phones, and hey, now we have the nuclear situation in Japan, which whether you like it or not affects the health of the world, let's not kid ourselves. The good news is there are various ways to protect ourselves, do a little research. One is bentonite clay. You can and should take it in pill form, but smearing it on your face acts as a form of detox and cleans your pores in the process. The only issue I see with this particular brand is the Propylene Glycol that is in it. It is unhealthy and has a drying affect, which my combination skin does not like at all. I also have sensitive skin. For that reason, I will be looking for a more soothing, more natural brand. My skin looks better for about a day after using this, which is why I only use it before events (weddings, etc)otherwise I get blemishes later. I think it is because the crud gets sucked out of my pores and ends up either getting partially stuck on the way out or just reeks havoc upon leaving my skin. Also, it makes my nose pores ooze oil for a bit. I find that annoying. This formula irritates me a little, like a mild burning sensation, which I am sure they could find a way to make that problem disappear by just removing the harsh glycol. I am thinking of messing with it, adding an ingredient to fix it somehow.	I wish the makers read my review and did something. I can dream, can't I?"

After I remove the ice pack, I use a Deep Pore Cleanser Lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.		Then I apply an herb mint facial mask which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out, and makes you look older.		Then moisturiser, then an anti-ageing eye balm, followed by a final moisturising protective lotion."

Helped with acne, not much with blackheads.","Being a guy in his mid-20's, buying a ""beauty masque"" from some check-out girl was something I wanted to avoid, so I turned to Amazon. Reading reviews always helps me, so here's mine.		Having suffered from mild to moderate acne for 10+ years and being in the middle of a breakout, I was desperate for a new remedy. Trying a clay masque was something I never thought I'd try, but Google talked me into it and figured it couldn't hurt my persistent blackhead problem. I read through all sorts of reviews and ended up picking this one. Per suggestion of my search efforts, I even held my towel covered head over a bowl of hot water (to open the pores?) before applying the masque the first time. I showered as soon as it dried, so when I noticed it really hadn't done much for my blackheads, I re-read the bottle and decided I'd try the wash cloth next time. Well, I tried it again a week later, but even with the wash cloth it still didn't pull the blackheads out like I was hoping.		I gave this 3 stars because I figured it would at least help rid my blackhead issue, which it didn't. But it DID seem to help my acne out some. It dried up the blemishes I had and pulled forming ones to the surface quicker, speeding along the healing process. So, I think it's definitely helped, just not in every way I was hoping it would. Your millage may vary."
B00008CMOS,2011,5,3.0,2,3,286,"WORKS SOMEWHAT, BUT IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS","I've had adult acne for quite a few years now, and have been given just about everything except Roaccutane (which I'm very hesitant to try after reading on all the side effects), with no success.  However, a couple years ago I decided to start taking various Vitamins by themself (rather than a multivitamin), so took Biotin, B12, Super B Complex, Vit E, C, Beta Carotene and Omega 3-6-9 and had clear skin from last year February until now.  However, recently have been having some serious breakouts in my chin area (due to stress I think) and my Dermatologist has put me on Ketoconazole antibiotics, Triamcinolone cream and Clindamycin spray for the past 2 months (also have eczema), but I just keep breaking out more!		In desperation I decided to ditch the cream and look for a masque.  The lady at the Beauty Store suggested Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque..never heard of it before, but she said it worked wonders for her.  Decided to try it the same evening (a week ago Saturday).  The next morning the pimples had all dried up considerably, but by mid-day I broke out with new comedones (whiteheads)!!  I nearly freaked out, but decided to check Amazon where I read others saying the same thing.  However, I decided to try applying the masque every day for a week as someone suggested and so far it has actually worked.  I do still break out with new ones the day after, but not as often, and it is that time of month, so that may explain why too.  I've therefore decided to try this for a couple more weeks and see what happens before I call it quits, so will give an update then."
B00008CMOS,2011,5,3.0,2,3,140,"Works in some ways, doesn't in others","I have moderate to severe acne and I bought this in hopes of drying out pimples and closing them pores up. I read that people use this for spot treatment, but it hasn't worked well in that function. The only thing that dries up is the mask itself after application.		For the other purpose of sucking up blackheads and closing pores, it works for a couple hours. Whether you apply it for 15 minutes like it says in the directions or if you keep it on overnight, the pores only stay clean for awhile. Pores are all part of genetics, and if you have big ones they are bound to gather up dirt and oils and stay humongous like mine. It does what it advertises which is why I gave it three stars. It just doesn't do it well enough."

However, I never mind trying something new and was looking for a mask to help with my problem skin and large pores. Now keep in mind, and product says that it shrinks your pores isn't being honest. Nothing can shrink your pores; pore size is genetic, but certain products help reduce the appearance of pores, and this is one of them. Of course it's not permanent, but nothing is. It also helped dry up the little acne I had. I typically keep it on overnight so when I wake up in the morning I cna wash it off and go through my day with soft skin."

On top of that the skin got a little loose under my eyes and more lines were starting to show -  it made me look old. Anyway, I bought this product to see if it would get rid of at least the breakout and oh my goodness, it worked WONDERFULLY. I left the mask on for an hour (it said 15 minutes, but I heard of some people leaving it on overnight, so I thought an hour would be fine.) When I took it off, my face was visibly tighter, smoother and cleaner. A lot of the blackheads and little bumps around my eyes and nose area were gone, as well as the 'tension lines' under my eye area(this was after ONE use). After the mask was off I immediatley put vitamin e moisterizer on and slept overnight. When I woke up, my face looked even smoother, im ecstatic I found this product!!! I have tried other face masks before but never with such great results).		Note: I have VERY dry and sensitive skin, so I was afraid to use this in the first place but my skin felt and looked rejuvenated afterward - it surprisingly didnt feel overly dry (just make sure to use a moisterizer after use). I also like this better then the Queen Helene Mud Mask (I tried that a few weeks ago as i thought it would be better for my sensitive skin, but it looked like i had even more bumps after one use). I'm going to keep using the mint Julep masque :-)		Cons: Well...it stings a bit when you put it on, so just do it in small sections (the stinging goes away after a few seconds, but dont lather it on in large chunks if you have sensitive skin)."

After the very first use of this product I was estatic! Right away the large pores around my nose looked visibly smaller and my face felt sooo soft and the next day it looked as if my acne was starting to clear up already. The second use gave the same results, so naturally I thought I had finally found my miracle product. However, it has now been three weeks of using this product twice a week and my positive thoughts of it have started to subside. It only seemed to of had an effect on my acne for the first week. My acne is now back and with a vengence. Instead of about a dozen large pimples I now have about three times that amount but in smaller form all around my problem areas(chin/cheeks/neck). As for my pores I can atleast happily say that they have stayed small as per the first use of the masque as well as my face still feels soft and my frown lines may have slightly faded. So my overall thoughts on this product are torn.		Pros:	*minimizes pores	*helps diminished the look of fine lines/wrinkles	*makes face soft		Cons:	*made acne smaller but increased amount of	*hasn't done anything to blackheads"
B00008CMOS,2012,6,4.0,2,2,339,"Works well","I've been using this product for a few years now... at first I was completely confused on how to use it because the directions are very minimum. Here's what I do:	1.) Wash face	2.) Exfoliate	3.) Apply a thin layer all over face & wait for it to dry	4.) Wash off and apply toner	5.) Lightly moisturize		A big problem I had was not knowing that I should physically exfoliate before applying the mask. I realized just how much of a difference it made... now that I exfoliate, I notice way more oil being extracted into the mask.		However, my pores do not shrink nor do they magically disappear. They do appear to be smaller since a lot of dirt had been lifted but by the end of the day, the dirt is back into my pores and I have to start this process all over again. (I wear makeup almost everyday)		I'll still keep using this product even though there isn't permanent changes. And I also believe that using this is better than not using a facial mask at all.		About my skin:	As far as the stinging, that only happened to me the first few times and now I don't feel anything but a cooling sensation. The mask use to gag me because it smells like a muddy mint smell but I've grown use to it. I typically do not have sensitive skin. I have oily to combo skin (oily on my T-zone, combo everywhere else) and I have a occasional break-outs. I do not think this product alone helps with acne.		Overall I think it's a good quality mask to treat your face to. I'm also trying to do what I can to prevent wrinkles and hopefully using this can slow the process.		I also agree with some of the reviews about the bottle. This mask is very thick and can be a hassle to get out (especially after the bottle is half empty) so if you can, look for it in a jar."

While it has gotten better, I've always had stubborn, large pores on my nose and cheeks, as well as large blackheads all over my face. I have insanely oily skin.

Im not a makeup guru so i don't wear make up too often, but i am a nut when it comes to my face, i hate zits and i have a strategy to get them to go away, and this is definitely step 1. On the few occasions that i do put foundation on , i will use this mask on my face first, let sit for 20 min wash off and your pores are instantly smaller and your face feels clean, put on a little moisturizer and a touch of foundation, and your good. Using this mask before hand makes the foundation go on smoother, and since pores will be smaller you end up using less foundation. Totally worth the money(not that it cost a lot)"

It's a refreshing cool mask that does leave your skin feeling rejuvinated and soft.  If you really love the whole ""spa"" experience then you'll be happy with what this product offers.		However, do not really expect this to do anything for your skin if you have acne.  It doesn't have any active ingredients in it that would really take care of that problem.

I love queen helene period, they have some great products.  I would not go without this, it really does clear out your pores and helps with acne and also just makes your skin look a little better every time you use it.  First time I used it I thought I had an allergic reaction to it because I thought it was stinging but really its not a stinging feeling it is at first or feels that way at first, but then its like a cool feeling, plus the only reason I thought it was going to break me out or that I was going to have an allergic reaction to it is because I had to some other product.  I have never had a bad reaction to this, its good for sensitive skin I think because I have sensitive skin. It feels great I think.

There were some bad points though.  The masque is quite thick, so it was somewhat difficult to squeeze the tube to get the goop out.  I wanted to use both hands, but I didn't want to get green gunk all over the tube.  I managed though.		Another con is that it dried out my face a little bit.  My forehead and nose are prone to dryness in the winter, but during the summer it's fine.  This masque made those areas dry again, but it wasn't too bad.		These problems don't outweigh the benefits though. The masque goes on and smooths out evenly.  At first, it seemed like it was going to burn a bit, but the sensation passed, and I was left with more of a minty, tingly sensation, which changed as the masque dried and tightened on my skin.  Washing it off was easy, and when I looked in the mirror, I noticed that my pores were smaller, and I looked refreshed.  My skin felt quite smooth and soft, too.  I didn't notice any difference, neither negative nor positive, on the one pimple I had.  It didn't burn or anything (though it wasn't 'open') and it didn't get any larger or smaller from the masque.		All in all, I really love this masque.  I can't wait to use it again, but I am hesitant to use it too much for fear of drying out my skin.  I think I'll leave this for my once-a-week girlie maintenance time."

But again, mines pretty old and half empty, I'll squeeze with all my might and get very little out. This mask is very affective in cleaning my pores, and helps reduce redness in pimples. Besides that, I haven't seen a drastic difference. This is only my second time using it though. I'm hoping it will make a big difference in removing most  (all) my blackheads and pimples. I have never had a white head problem, but my nose and chin are practically covered in blackheads and its embarrassing. Far away you can't see them,but up close I'm a horror show. I have extremely sensitive skin, and have had no allergic reactions to it. It drys rather quickly, leaving a tight feeling on your skin. To wash off, I suggest using a warm wash cloth. Cold water won't make the mask budge (just putting that out there incase anyone trys washing it off with cold and has a heart attack when it doesn't come off).

I love Queen Helene's masques - I've tried several and they all work well, but this one is my favorite.  I've tried other brands of masques, too, but they aren't as good.		This masque is probably not good for anyone with sensitive skin because it tingles.  I have sensitive skin under my nose, so I don't put it there because the first time I did, it burned so bad.  But anyway, if you wash your face with a good cleanser first and then put this on for about 20-30 minutes, let it dry and then wash off - your face will be so refreshed. I could see my angry red pimples get smaller and less angry, and I could also tell that my forehead was less oily but my cheeks were not too dry (I have combination skin).  I could feel the reduced inflammation, too - sore pimples are less sore.  The next morning, the size diminished a lot more too - but you have to keep up with your washing.  I wouldn't recommend using this more than 1-2 times per week just because of its strength - when I need to use a masque more often, I use a milder masque (specifically Queen Helene's grape seed extract peel-off masque) 2 times and then the Mint Julep masque just once."

Well, I apparently put the masque really close to my lips or actually got on to my lips. Let me tell you, it started to get warm then burning sensation. It felt like I rubbed habanero pepper over my lips. I couldn't wait another 12 minutes, so I pretty much rinsed it off right after I put the masque on.

Sometimes my face will clear up but then, boom, I have cystic pimples all over my chin...I'm very diligent about washing my face and moisturizinig with oil-free moisturizers but just recently my chin area exploded with zits.  I went to Rite Aid and came across this acne system and thought, ""why not...I'm desperate.""  I figured it wouldn't work like all of the other somewhat expensive cleansers I've bought, but I was wrong.  THIS WORKS!!!!!  I wash my face with the main cleanser in the morning and then dab on the lotion on all of my zits and problem areas.  I don't put it on my whole face, as it dries my skin out.  After dabbing on the lotion and letting it dry (I've noticed my skin feels tight), I rub on a hypoallergenic oil-free moisturizer of my own and let it dry before doing my make-up for the day.  At night, I do the same routine, except that after adding the lotion, letting it dry, putting on my own moisturizer and letting it dry, I dab on the system's lotion (again) on any existing zits and they usually get dried out and zapped in my sleep.  My face is finally clear, so now I'm just using the lotion on my acne scars and they are fading as well.  For the first time in my adult life I've found something that finally helps clear up my face and stay that way.  I've still gotten a pimple or two, but I immediately dab on the lotion and keep them under control.  I can actually not wear foundation and not feel self-conscious.  Hope it works for you all! I'm a lifelong custmer now, this stuff is GOLD!!!!"
B000EPA4FW,2010,1,5.0,1,1,125,"I can't recommend this enough","I have combination skin (oily in the T-zone) suffered from acne throughout high school, and enlarged pores since college. I'm in my mid-twenties, and I'm on my fifth set of this system. LOVE IT! For the first time, I no longer have to wear concealer or foundation - my skin is almost completely clear, and my pores are visibly smaller. And I no longer have to powder my nose in the middle of the day.		The cleanser can be a little drying with twice a day use, but I find that extra moisturizer really helps to balance that out, and the results are worth it.		Also, Amazon's price is significantly cheaper than any store I've come across, so will purchase from here in the future."
B000EPA4FW,2010,1,5.0,1,1,156,"An Honest review","At first I was skeptical about using any other products but Proactive's system. Proactive really helped clear away a lot of my blemishes and scars and really made my skin perfect. After 2 years of not using it, I started breaking out like when I was in high school again and so I bought this product over the counter. It was cheap enough to risk and try it out. So far my face is clearing up nicely, unlike other products I have used (no thanks clean and clear). Any who, I only have one negative about this product and it's that it dries your face up pretty quickly if you use to much of the acne killing bottle, but I just balance it out with a bit of moisturizer. Specifically L'Oreals ""Active Daily Moisture Lotion"". SO if you cant get your hands on Proactive's system or looking for a cheap alternative, this is a fantastic product."
B000EPA4FW,2010,0,5.0,1,1,91,Amazing!,"At 29 years old, I've suffered from moderate to severe acne since I was 16.  I have tried everything from Proactiv to prescription creams and pills (a total of 6 failed prescriptions).  After using Neutrogena for 3 months, I have perfectly clear skin.  I do get an occasional zit here and there, but my face is no longer covered with acne.	The cleanser doesn't dry out my face at all.  The spf lotion is amazingly light and I don't even feel it on my skin.	I highly recomment this to anyone!"
B000EPA4FW,2009,9,5.0,1,1,319,"It worked immediately!","I started breaking out about 2 months ago.  There was acne all over the sides of my face.  It wouldn't clear up on its own so I knew I had to do something about it.  I've broken out in the past before and tried Proactive and Retin A before (topical treatment) and both did not work for me!  In fact, both those products made me break out more.  I don't know why that is because it seems to work wonders for other people.  I decided to try this product because I had seen it in a drugstore before.  My face was even more swollen and painful after many extractions I got from a facial.  One day after the facial, I started using the face wash and acne lotion as directed.  In as little as two days, my acne started clearing up!  I could see a significant difference.  I dried up the acne and I could feel how tight my skin felt after washing my face with this product.  I didn't start peeling from the dry skin until about a week and a half into using the product.  In a week my skin was almost back to normal, I just have some scarring now from some of the acne.  I would definitely recommend this product.  When my mom saw that I had purchased this acne system she told me don't use drugstore products!  You don't know how it'll affect your face, they probably use cheap ingredients in the product.  I'm glad I didn't listen because it's not true!  It worked for me.  I may switch to a normal face wash and lotion again now that my skin is cleared up (2 weeks into using the product), it does dry up your skin but that is much BETTER than having acne all over.  But if I ever break out again I will definitely go back to Neutrogena's Complete Acne Therapy System!"
B000EPA4FW,2009,4,3.0,1,1,177,"Didn't work as well as ProActive for me","My acne is not bad.  If I stay away from dairy and get enough sleep I usually don't have a problem.  Please tell me who gets enough sleep...... Thank you!  Even though Proactiv is expensive it does work for me.... thought I would try cheaper Neutrogena to see if it works, and I have to say it does but not consistently - which is of course the whole point.  If I were to go off to a Monastery where red face spots wouldn't matter then I could take this, but Proactiv has a better success rate for me.		The micro-beads in the Neutrogena skin washer are too micro to really do anything for me.  Also, with the Proactiv 2nd step - the reactivating toner (really meaningless name) - when used with a cotton swab, actually takes more dirt away from my face even after I've used Proactivs Face cleanser (first step) and it has better microbeads than Neutrogena.		I'd say bottom line Neutrogena better than plain soap, but not a consistent winner for me.  Gonna stick w/Proactiv"
B000EPA4FW,2009,3,5.0,1,1,203,"Finally cleared adult acne after Rx, Clinique, & Proactiv failed!","I've been dealing with constant but moderate adult acne since age 23 (I'm now 28).  Proactive did not work, it made my skin worse, and an expensive prescription cream made my skin red and peely, and contributed to visable wrinkles due to the drying. Clinique's 3-step made my skin not as bad, but I'd still have zits all over. I've used this system for 1 month, my skin has NEVER been better (even during 'that' time of the month)!  This product cleared whiteheads, blackheads, and those awful, deep zits all over my face and neck in 3 days flat without drying my face out. Now, for the first time since I was 19, I'm going without foundation or concealor and spending a lot less time getting ready in the morning.  You should shake the face wash every time before using, the beads of exfoliant float to the top of the tube if you store it upright.  I only use the wash at night, so as not to over-exfoliate, and Cetaphil in the mornings.  The kit should last me 2 months, and all 3 products look like they'll run out at the same time.  This system is worth more than $10 a month! Wonderful!"
B000EPA4FW,2009,1,4.0,1,1,166,"first time reviewer","Was looking around for some additional acne products because I like using new products and seeing how my skin reacts to them.  Still trying to clear some minor acne around my chin area (like two pimples and a little scarring) so I wasn't too impressed about that.  However I have to say...it did pretty well in terms of preventing new acne from forming, which you all know, is very annoying.  I've slept about 5 hours two nights in a row this past week and my skin generally looks and feels pretty gross when I wake up (sleep-deprived and not so rosy).  I'm a huge fan of Neutrogena products anyway so I wasn't disappointed.  There are other products out there that have had much better results, but in terms of reducing acne/preventing new ones from forming, this product works pretty quickly.  So yes, I would totally recommend!  P.S. Even though this doesn't allow for the 1/2 star option but I'm still going to give it 4.5 stars."
B000EPA4FW,2008,10,2.0,1,1,79,"Didn't work for me.","First impression: lots of perfume in the products.  Dried the face, gave rough patches on the sides of my cheeks.  Got rid of blackheads, but that was all.  Did not prevent cystic acne.  Got rid of average pimples by drying harshly, and many more returned in its place.  I used for 1.5 months before giving up.  I'm going back to a less harsh routine, which is probably better for my face anyway.  I feel this product made acne worse."
B000EPA4FW,2008,9,4.0,1,1,149,Alright,"I use another acne product, but after moving to CA I couldn't find it anywhere. Since I was busy packing and couldn't use the internet to order it online I stopped by my local Target and got the Neutrogena Acne System. There's a cleanser, day lotion, night lotion.	The cleanser in the beginning seem pretty good, but after about a month's use it's okay. I probably will go back to my other acne system. I only have mild acne that doesn't break out a lot.	The day lotion is useful since it also has 15 SPF. Perfect, since I don't have to apply two types of lotion in the morning rush hour.	The night lotion is awkward...it makes your skin all tight and such. Probably the main reason why I won't purchase this system. Neutrogena products are great, but I this acne treatment doesn't do the job for me."
B000EPA4FW,2008,1,5.0,3,3,117,AMAZING,"If I could give this product more stars I would. I suffer from adult acne and normally have several breakouts on my jaw line, chin, forehead and cheeks with many of them being the large, sore, cysts...yikes! I have tried AcneFree, ProActiv (on it for 2 years b/c it worked the best of anything but still not fantastic results), recently I picked up Advanced Solutions and 1 week later I had perfectly clear skin. I thought I was going to have to go to a dermatologist but low and behold there is a less invasive answer. You have to give it a good week to two weeks and you HAVE to use all three steps . AWESOME"
B000EPA4FW,2006,11,5.0,5,6,69,"Good Stuff!!","This product is so much better than Proactiv and so much cheaper. I am a woman in her 40's whose skin decided to turn on me at this stage of the game. Sometimes my acne (around the chin line and nose ) would be horrible I bought this stuff and now my face is clear as a bell a little drying(around the nose area) but nothing moisterizer can't help!"
B000EPA4FW,2006,10,5.0,7,9,66,"As good as brands you have to order  if not better","I've been using Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Complete Acne Therapy System for a year now. I had to switch over when I developed a sensitivity to my other acne control system.		I think it's great and even more effective than the other system. I love that they give a moisturizer, but I regret that there is no toner included.		Plus, it's more affordable than the other products."
B000EPA4FW,2008,7,1.0,9,12,95,"Broken out","I used Proactiv for a long time. I have also tried everything else possible. The first 2 days of using Neutrogena felt good and my face felt clean. The third day, I woke up with a huge painful pimple and throughout the next week of using the product, I had 4-5 HUGE pimples all over my face. I had previously only had a few small ones here and there, so this product made it way worse. I switched back to Proactiv and my face has pretty much cleared up in a short amount of time."
B000EPA4FW,2006,0,5.0,9,12,62,"Works Great!","I started using this item yesterday. I have been using it as well as the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Gel, and already, in about 36 hours, my face is reasonably clearer. I have been using the Neutrogena blackout scrub/acne wash for about 6 months now, but it just wasn't able to keep up with my acne, and so far, it seems this can."
B000EPA4FW,2012,10,5.0,2,2,102,"Great system!","I simply love this product!  Initially, my skin became mildly dry when I used the system.  However after two weeks, my skin improved dramatically.  Before using these products, I had severe acne; I couldn't touch my face without getting a pimple as a result.  I literally had pimples all over my face.  It was a horrible experience for me.  And to make matters worse, I couldn't find a solution to the problem.  I finally gave Neutrogena a try, and I love it!  I use all three products twice a day, and this regimen has kept my skin clear for over four months!"
B000EPA4FW,2012,4,5.0,2,2,174,"IN LOVE WITH NEUTROGENA","I never write reviews. Ever. But I am in LOVE with the way this makes my face look. Not only did it help clear up minor bumps, but blemishes and it helped to clear out my pores and reduce them significantly. I used to be afraid to walk out of the house without make-up on, now I have a skin tone that isnt ruined by huge red splotches and is even and beautiful! I saw results in about two days, around day 4-5 my face started to dry out, but I just decided to use the lotion at that point (which I wasn't originally using) and its been GREAT ever since.		Since I dont have terrible skin (I have moderately oily skin and minor bumps and blemishes) I only use this once a day after my shower in the AM. I then use the Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Scrub every night and sometimes the Clear Pore Mask/Moisturizer as a Mask (every 3-4 days) just for that super fresh feel! Oh, and some lotion! :D"
B000EPA4FW,2011,7,5.0,2,2,183,"Works, but full results take time","Of all the acne treatments I have used I've gotten the best results with this product. I am in my mid-twenties and had little acne as a teenager. Several years ago I started to occasionally break-out in large, persistent blemishes on my chin and forehead. I saw some improvement with over the counter and prescription regimens. But I would still get monthly breakouts on my chin. When I first started using this product I didn't notice a dramatic change; I still had some good skin days and some bad ones. Over several months I definitely notice a big improvement. My skin no longer feels oil at the end of the day and the number of ""bad skin days"" a month has shrunken to 1 or 2. I do find that I have to be persistent. If I don't use the product for a day or two I start to slide back.		I would recommend this product to others who have moderate acne, but haven't been able to kick it with other drug store products. I am definitely glad I gave it a try."

I had tried everything under the sun from prescription to over the counter products.  This is the only product that has worked for me over the last 25 years...it even beat Proactive hands down.  I highly recommend this!!!"
B000EPA4FW,2011,1,5.0,2,2,123,"Absolutely the best.","One of the hardest decisions regarding acne is what type and brand to choose. There are many out there saying they are ""the best."" I have had acne for years now, but nothing too severe. I was tired of the irritated redness and zits that would just appear overnight.		I heard good things about Neutrogena. I have owned this kit for two days and already see drastic improvements. This products really works. The one thing that people don't understand is that it's not just the product that makes the difference, it's the constant application. You HAVE to stick with it. You cannot use only when you get that one breakout. If you use this kit as directed everyday, you will not be sorry."
B000EPA4FW,2007,11,5.0,0,0,41,"Very good","Got the item right on time :) I could already seen less pimple appearances after the first night. Amazing compare to crappy doctor prescription stuffs. It does make your face less oily with that special sun lotion. I am Very happy."

I seriously tried EVERYTHING..probably 50..ask my mom..LOL..including proactive..which is possibly the worst acne medication..due to the OVERDOSE on benzyol peroxide!  Benzoyl peroxide makes yoru face EXTREMELY DRY and by puttin it on DAY AND NIGHT..your skin will barely be able to move!		Nuetrogena gives a perfect balance of both sacylic(sp??) acid and benzoyl peroxide.  In the morning you treat your face with the sacylic acid which helps prepare your skin for the benzyol peroxide you put on at night!  My skin cleared up completely in about a month!		Umm...the one thing a suggest is that you use a ACNE mask like ""Queen helen mint julep mask"" (sold at your nearest beauty supply store for 5 bucks) because the neutrogena system (like every other acne product) is not PERECT..it needs a little help.  The mint julep mask should replace the benzoyl peroxide gel and be put on once a week OVERNIGHT on the face..and washed off once awake.  If little pimples do come up..you can use spot treatment with the mask OVERNIGHT and wash it off in the morning!  But ALWAYS use the mask on the ENTIRE face overnight ONCE a week..and spot treatment if necessary during the week...		Great product tho..wouldn't trade it! The sunscreen moisturizer is awesome..smells great. THe skin polisher smels great and feeels and looks like it does polish your skin.  GREAT SYSTEM all together."

I've read complaints about it being too drying, but this is the first product that I have used (on my extremely dry skin!) that leaves it feeling fresh and moisturized.  I only use the night cream to spot treat, and that seems to be working really well for me.		The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it's taking a while for my acne to disappear.  I had two pimples on my check before I started using it, and they are both still there (though much smaller--they're more of a discoloration now).  The best part is I've only had two pimples start to come up, but after putting the night cream on them, they've both disappeared.  I love it!"

My skin is usually very sensitive to products, but I haven't had any problems with this product. My skin feels smoother than it has in years! I have tried proactiv and several other cleansers, but none ever worked. My search is finally over as well as my acne!! I highly recommend!!"

With the exception of AcneFree (which eventually quit working for me) this is the only product that does not irritate my skin and works well.  I use Clinque for all my makeup, but even their systems don't do well on my skin.  It's also the only product that has even started to help with cleaning the pores on my nose etc.  I love this product.

I still break out with a zit or two every other week; which is a lot better than when I was using ProActiv, which was about a couple of blemishes and dry, flaky skin every week!

B000EPA4FW,2006,10,4.0,3,5,54,"Great for clearing acne","I had small acne-like bumps on my upper arm.  The cleanser (with fine granules for exfoliation) coupled with the night treatment were great in clearing up all the bumps on my arm.  It tends to be a little drying.  It also comes with a good day-time moisturizer.  Also, a plus is the great price."
B000EPA4FW,2011,3,1.0,1,2,269,"Product sent me to the ER, company couldn't care less","I have now contacted J&J 11 times because the lotion - used at HALF the normal strength - caused a ""chemical burn"" (term used by the ER doctor) so bad I had to go to the emergency room. My face was red, swollen and literally oozing. (I have pictures.) The doc gave me steroids to calm the swelling and it took over a month for the condition to subside to anything reasonable. My face is still red and blotchy and is still oozing water at times. Their response? They sent me a check to cover the cost of the product with a letter saying that if I cashed the check I could never claim any other compensation from them. Really. I didn't cash the check; I don't know if I'm going to need some kind of treatment to make my skin look halfway normal again. These people are now ignoring me; they closed the case because I ""refused"" to fill out forms I had already sent to them a month beforehand. (""We can't seem to find them,"" is their side of it.) All you have to do is Google ""johnson and johnson complaints"" to see how much trouble this company is in. Their products are being recalled right and left, and they have been accused of wrongdoing by the SEC. This company is full of bottom feeders who couldn't care less about their customers. Do NOT use this product if you have fair skin or sensitive skin. The warnings on the label are completely inadequate. If you experience the same thing I did, expect to be treated very poorly."
B000EPA4FW,2012,8,4.0,1,1,272,"It works for me","I have hormonal acne, so every once a month I get those painful, just-under-the-skin breakouts that I can't even get with a comedone extractor. And I noticed that it had gotten worse -- usually it clears out after that time of the month, but I guess my sebacious glands are on hyperdrive (I may be lucky to have oily skin way past puberty, but it still has drawbacks). I was skeptical with Proactiv (too costly), and I really didn't want to spend too much to start with in a 3-stage acne treatment system, so I decided to give this Neutrogena system a shot. I was not disappointed.		I bought this a month ago, and I decided to wait for a little over a month to see if it's effective against my monthly breakouts. I have oily skin (on the T-zone), and it minimized the pimples and whiteheads on my cheeks and forehead in a couple weeks. I really was happy with the difference it made.		I only use this twice a day, just a pea-sized amount of the cleanser, and a little less of it for the acne lotion. I wait for a minute or so for it to dry, then apply the SPF15 lotion. Then you can apply whatever makeup you use afterwards.		Now, I won't say it's 100% effective (nothing is in the real world), I still do get the usual tiny pimples on my pimple-prone areas, but my face cleared out and the mild breakouts I've had was not as angry and usually cleared up after a couple days as long as I stuck to my regular application schedule."
B000EPA4FW,2012,3,5.0,1,1,200,"Would recommend!","I've struggled with acne all through high school and into college; I've tried numerous acne products (even acutane) and nothing seemed to work... Until I started using this product. The Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System has been the only acne medication that has worked for my skin (my skin is a combination of oily and dry and I tended to break out in the T zone).  Since using this product I have seen significant improvement. I still have minor breakouts from time to time but nothing like before. I did experience a little drying of the skin when I first started using the product so for the first couple weeks I only used it once a day and gradually increased to twice a day; I would suggest anyone with sensitive skin to do this as well. It took about a week after starting the treatment for my skin to clear up, though the pimples were less red after the first couple uses. I've been using it for over a year now and am very pleased with it. Everyone's skin reacts differently to different treatments but I would definetly recommend any one struggling with acne to give this product a try."
B000EPA4FW,2012,2,3.0,1,1,220,"Didn't stand out to me","I was looking for a product to help with adult hormonal acne, and the reviews made me think the Neutrogena (a great brand) Complete Acne Therapy System would be the best. Unfortunately, for me, it didn't do significantly better or worse than any other acne wash, spot treatment, or moisturizer out there. If I used the wash regularly, I did notice my acne was a little better during that time of the month, and the spot treatment, while very drying, wasn't as irritating as some other brands. I think my favorite product was the moisturizer, especially for the sun protection it offered, but for the small tube you get, I just don't know it it really stands out in a crowd. Also, the tubes for the spot treatment and the moisturizer are exactly the same--even the names are similar. More than once, I went for a big dollop of moisturizer, only waste a ton of the spot treatment.		Overall, if you have problem skin, I do think you should give this product a try. It's a good deal and it's nice to get all components of acne treatment in one kit. Same rules for any acne treatment apply: it's drying, can be a little irritating, etc. However, for me, it just didn't stand out enough for me to buy again."
B000EPA4FW,2012,1,4.0,1,1,70,"Best so far!","I'm a 21 yr old black guy and i gotta say great product this is, worked better than I expected. I've gotten better results with this than I did with proactiv, true story! Now I know everyone skin is different & results may vary, but I haven't had one breakout since I started using it about a month ago. No complaints & only 20 bucks, I'll definitely keep purchasing this."
B000EPA4FW,2011,7,5.0,1,1,67,"Works wonders!","I've tried a lot of acne kits, even those expensive ones, & none of them worked. Then I saw this while looking around Amazon & read the reviews.

B000EPA4FW,2011,7,4.0,1,1,159,"Works Well For Me","I like this product...It does a great job of clearing up my face when I use it properly. It's a lot cheaper than Proactiv and has worked just as well as that product did (although I haven't used Proactiv in ~6yrs, it never impressed me much for the price). The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that the active ingredient in one of the 3 tubes, benzoyl peroxide, has ended up bleaching the collars of many of my shirts. I don't know if it's just me, maybe I accidentally rub my face all over my collar without realizing it. But a lot of my shirt collars paid the price before I even realized what was happening. In the end I've had to resort to using the benzoyl peroxide product only at night before bed, and just using the face wash and moisturizer in the morning. It doesn't work quite as well but my shirts thank me."
B000EPA4FW,2011,2,4.0,1,1,207,"Affordable and Amazing treatment for adult acne","I am 25 years old and my face has been breaking out more frequently. I don't have terrible acne, but when I break out I get pretty bad blemish spots for a period of time. I have tried everything like washing pillow cases multiple times a week, washing my hair brush, switching make-up. Nothing has helped. I've even paid a dermatologist hundreds of dollars for prescription medications that really don't work.		Today is Monday. I bought this product on Friday and started using it that night. My face is already notably brighter and clearer. 90% of my blemishes have already disappeared. I even noticed these last 3 days that my face isn't near as oily during the day as it used to be.		ONLY WARNING: Be very careful when using the cleanser and acne control lotion around your eyes. I was very careful not to get it near my eyes, yet I still had some irritation on the outside corner of my eye. I used a little Curel original formula lotion (any non-scented lotion) on it, though, and it cleared up. If you have sensitive skin or skin that dries out easily I would also use some type of night moisturizer (I use Neutrogena's light night cream)."
B000EPA4FW,2010,7,4.0,1,1,274,"Give this a try first.","I have relatively clear skin, but I started breaking out in college. I've never had huge breakouts that covered my entire face in bumps, just spots around my nose, forehead, and chin. I also have hormonal breakouts and the occasional cystic pimple. So I'd recommend this to people with mild to moderate acne and flareups.		 I tried this when it first came out because the reviews were so positive, and it worked great for me. Definitely worked better than ProActiv, at a lower price and without the hassle of a monthly bill and getting stuck in an auto-shipment.		It doesn't smell bad- not great, but it doesn't smell like you're putting a ton of acne stuff on your face. And I love the two different lotions you get. The day lotion is great, light, and has SPF. The night lotion is heavier and great at zapping zits. The cleanser is gentle but exfoliating. All together, the system works great.		I do wish the individual lotions/cleanser were sold separately. It's convenient having them all in a kit, but I ran out of everything at different times. I used up the cleanser first, then the day lotion, then the night lotion. But I had to buy a whole new kit and replace everything, so it seemed a little wasteful. Also, like any acne kit, this can be drying, so you may need another moisturizer, especially in the winter.		My skin has calmed down since I first used this, but I'd still recommend this. Try this product first before you call an informercial- of all the acne systems I've used, this one gave me the best results."
B000EPA4FW,2010,7,2.0,1,1,220,"Skin Polishing Face Wash seems to be the CULPRIT","I've used many different kinds of products and systems. Crazy to think how much money I've spent over the years. However, NOTHING was as drying and irritating as this. It felt OK after the first use. After repeated uses however, my face and neck were so dry and irritated it hurt to make facial expressions.		I tried using it just every other day and moisturizing frequently and it helped a little, but the combination of all three products still made my face really uncomfortable.		Eventually I abandoned it and went back to one of my favorite products which is the Neutrogena 2 in 1 blackhead removing pads. They aren't very strong, only 0.5% SA and they're very good at removing dead skin. It helped my skin recover a lot.		I began to think that it was either the acne lotion or moisturizer that made my skin so dry because i've used 2.5% BP before and it was fine. And well, if a moisturizer is drying, that makes little sense. So I began using the pads instead of the polishing wash and then put the acne control lotion and the moisturizer on after.		Seems to work better. Not nearly as drying. I don't exactly know what's in the wash. I've never had such a bad reaction to an SA wash before."
B000EPA4FW,2010,7,5.0,1,1,374,"I can go out without foundation...","In my mid-30s, I have been experiencing more aggressive acne over the past few years.  I seem to find a product that helps, then it goes off the market :(  Lately, nothing has been helping.  5 days ago, I did some research online and found, like other reviewers have said, that a combination of Salicylic Acid and Benzoyl Peroxide seems to provide the best relief.  So I went to my local big box store and decided to take a chance on this product... I am SO glad I did!!!  Within 2-3 days my active breakouts were significantly healed, including a large cystic breakout that had become quite infected. And I have not noticed any new breakouts since starting to use this product.		Per the packaging, this system ""starts clearing breakouts in just 2 days"".  It claims to work faster than Proactiv, and shows it's effectiveness in clinical trials on the back of the package.  It uses a three part system: step 1 - skin polishing acne cleanser with 0.5% salicylic acid and microfine exfoliating beads; step 2 - acne control lotion with prescription-grade benzoyl peroxide; step 3 - oil-free SPF 15 lotion with calming botanical complex. Although it doesn't mention it anywhere else on the package, under the cleanser directions, it does mention that the product contains AHA (an alpha hydroxy acid) in case you are sensitive to that.		I LOVE how simple this kit is.  I am not one to wash, tone, etc. etc. etc.  I simply wash my face at night with the Skin Polishing Acne Cleanser, followed by the Overnight Acne Control Lotion.  Whenever I try to wash my face twice a day, it increases breakouts, so I didn't even try with this.  In the morning, I put Neutrogena's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000052YJX"">Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne Treatment, Vanishing Formula, 0.75 oz (21 g)</a> on any remaining breakout spots, and follow with the Sun Shield Day Lotion from the kit, then apply my typically minimal makeup. I was even tempted to leave the house this morning without having applied my makeup, my skin is so clear! I am so happy to have gotten this kit, and I hope it remains on the market! My kit even contained a $4 coupon off my next kit purchase."
B000EPA4FW,2007,3,2.0,13,15,110,Ouch!,"I recently used this system and experienced immense irritation and drying of my skin. After 2 days of use, even foundation was painful to wear. Then, my skin flaked off in big chunks. I use Neutrogena products such as the On-The-Spot Acne treatment and several moisturizers with no problems. I think that using the 3 products in this system at once can be harmful for sensitive skin.		I'm sure for people who don't have sensitive skin, it must work. If you do, try it on just a patch of skin first and not your whole face. The packaging is nice and attractive, so that's why I gave it 2 stars."
B000EPA4FW,2011,1,5.0,5,5,381,"AMAZING! Wait for the results!","I have been suffering with acne since my early 20's (I'm now 28) and I have tried EVERY product out there. Nothing ever seemed to work, even the highly toted Pro-Activ. I started using this stuff on a whim and was surprised by the results. When I got back from my Iraq deployment my face was HORRIBLE! Nothing I would do could make it any better. I tried chemical peels and all sorts of cleansers, masks, toners, etc. I had seen a review on here a woman made about this product being good for adult acne. So, I went down to Target and decided to give it a try. I vowed to make a review after I waited at least three months to see if the product really worked. Good new...IT DOES! (I started using this back in November 2010, it's now February 2011). I had the initial breakout where the product was purging all the nasties from my pores...I also had the DRY, DRY skin. Try to get past it. It won't last forever once your skin gets used to the products, I promise. I did find that the oil-free lotion wasn't moisturizing enough for me at night, so I mix pure aloe and pure vitamin E oil (70k I.U.) and slather that on my face about an hour after the BP lotion (to give my skin time to absorb the lotion). I find that the aloe/vitamin E mix also helps with the hyperpigmentation left after the pimple/zit goes away. If you find the oil-free moisturizer isn't moisture enough for the day, try mixing it with another Neutrogena day lotion. I like the moisture for combination skin OR the 'wrinkle free' moisturizer with Retin-A. The second lotion isn't oil free, so I use it on the days my skin feels extra dry.		Anyway, I've seen a lot of bad reviews on here for this product, with a lot of them referring to the dry skin it gives you or saying that after a week or two their faces looked worse...that's to be expected!! It takes your skin about 3 months to adjust to a product. Only then can you determine whether or not it's working. Please give this a chance...if you decide not to, well...that's cool too...more for me!! :)"
B000EPA4FW,2007,11,4.0,4,4,167,"Good stuff for a girl on a budget.","I've been using this product to treat my adult acne for about a year.  It works better than Proactiv and better than the Philosophy salicylic acid regimen and it's much less expensive.  The SPF 15 in the moisturizer is nice, too.		Though I haven't had perfect, miraculous results with the Neutrogena kit, I've been better able to control my acne with this than anything else I've tried.  I've found my skin to be smoother, I have less redness and fewer pimples.  The blemishes I do get seem to be smaller and fade faster and my skin seems less oily.		I also like that it's only two steps, twice a day.  As a busy mom I really appreciate being able to do my entire skincare regimen in less than four minutes.		The only reason I gave this product four stars instead of five is because it didn't completely clear up my acne.  But I'm starting to think that's not going to happen without the help of a dermatologist."
B000EPA4FW,2011,10,5.0,4,4,167,"Benzoyl Peroxide is key to clearing my acne","I am 26 with mild to moderate acne. I've been using this product for about a year. I recommend it to all of my friends. It works if you are consistant with the regimine. Wash your face with the cleanser in the morning, use the moisturizer during the day (a little goes a long way with everything)Wash again at night & use a thin layer of the the benzoyle peroxide on areas that are broken out, follow with a moisturizing night cream of your choice. The benzoyl peroxide gel is harsh at first & will dry out your skin... but it WORKS and your skin will get used to it. Give it 2 weeks. Another thing to be mindful about is that the benzoyle peroxide will bleach your pillow case, but for me it's worth having clear skin. I just buy light colored pillow cases, no big deal. This stuff works for me. I use it everyday and have clear skin. I will always buy this product."
B000EPA4FW,2008,9,5.0,4,4,190,"It Works!!!!!","I love this product. I am 40 and my skin leans toward the oily side. My acne seemed to continuously get worse. I have tried almost everything, inclucing seeking the help of a dermatologist. I was very skeptical of this product thought it was for teens, but I am so glad I tried it. The cleanser takes a little getting use to, and so does the consistency of the acne control lotion. Here is a tip especially if you are having a lot of drying. I always add a little water to the acne control lotion it is very thick and this makes it easy to spread a smaller amount over my face without pulling (have to worry about those wrinkles). Don't skip the oil free spf lotion. I use all products morning and night; however there are some nights I use my wrinkle creme instead of the oil free lotion, and I haven't had any problems with that. I never bother reviewing products but this one is definitely one I am promoting, because it really made a huge difference for me. I will use this product forever. It works!!"
B000EPA4FW,2008,3,1.0,6,7,54,"Did not clear up acne, harsh on skin...","I used this product for over a month it did not clear up acne, seemed to for the first week then skin just got worse and worse. It was also really harsh on my skin, dried out areas especially around nose. I love Neutrogena products, but this one just did not work for me..."
B000EPA4FW,2008,1,5.0,3,3,117,AMAZING,"If I could give this product more stars I would. I suffer from adult acne and normally have several breakouts on my jaw line, chin, forehead and cheeks with many of them being the large, sore, cysts...yikes! I have tried AcneFree, ProActiv (on it for 2 years b/c it worked the best of anything but still not fantastic results), recently I picked up Advanced Solutions and 1 week later I had perfectly clear skin. I thought I was going to have to go to a dermatologist but low and behold there is a less invasive answer. You have to give it a good week to two weeks and you HAVE to use all three steps . AWESOME"
B000EPA4FW,2011,9,5.0,3,3,228,"Has worked for me very well","I think it's tough to review a product like this because whether something works seems very dependent on what type of skin you have - it's specific to the person.  To help out, I'll say that I'm in my 20s and I have oily/combination skin.  I'd developed acne as an adult (didn't really have pimples as a teen) and had used prescription creams last year (Epiduo and an oral antibiotic).  The prescription medication worked really really well, cleaned up the worst of it, but was expensive and fairly harsh (I couldn't wax my eyebrows for example).  I was looking for something milder and over-the-counter.		I've been using the acne system for 3 weeks now.  It did not work within 2 days for me.  In fact, at first, all it seemed to do was make parts of my face turn red and peely.  I followed advice and began using the acne cleanser about 2-3 per week (rather than the daily, as directed) and used the acne lotion every other day.  The redness has gone away and my skin has cleared up and really looks great.  Hopefully it will continue to work.		So that's my advice - give it time, and don't be afraid to use it a little less to spare your skin.  And remember to be careful with the lotion as it will bleach your clothes and hair."
B000EPA4FW,2010,9,5.0,3,3,152,"My skin looks better than it has in 14 years!","I absolutely LOVE this product. I would describe my skin as oily, everywhere, not just the T-zone. Very acne prone with mainly whiteheads or the very deep infections that take a couple weeks to disappear but not without leaving a nice little scar. I cannot touch my face, ever. I'm pretty much guaranteed to get a zit wherever I place a finger.  I am African American so the scars seem to be more prominent (to me anyway).  Anyway, The Acne Therapy System has been very successful with not only making my acne disappear but also improving my skin tone and color uniformity. Many of the scars have faded and my skin just looks fresh! It has also been very effective at removing my Dermablend makeup which, if you have no experience with this foundation, is very difficult to remove. I've been recommending this product to everyone I know. $20 is a steal!"
B000EPA4FW,2008,6,5.0,3,3,151,"This stuff actually works!","I have been using this for about a week and a half and it is working absolutely wonderfully! I started developing mild adult acne (I'm 25 and I have never had it before! Not fun!) so instead of making an appointment with the dermatologist, I decided to try to find something store bought that would work. This has been perfect! My skin was clear by about the 3rd day or so..I even got my brows waxed, which tends to make me breakout, and nothing! The biggest bonus is that the usual blackheads I get are considerably (visibly) diminished and hopefully will be gone soon. I will say that it tends to tighten and dry my skin after washing it with the cleanser at night, so after using the night lotion, I apply a face cream once the night lotion stuff has dried. This seems to keep my skin from drying out."

Benzoyl Peroxide Lotion-- great work! 2.5% is the best lowest dose on acne. My acne has cleared up and I don't get the huge ones anymore. However, because BP is known to dry the skin, it's best to put on a GOOD moisturizer afterwards. I know most people don't do anything after applying this lotion and that's why they complain of dryness. FIND A GOOD MOISTURIZER! I use Aveeno SPF 15 during the day and Clinique Dramatically Different Gel/Lotion at night. Also, results work best with applied frequently! It might take a couple days for your skin to get used to this, but aim for at least twice a day of this lotion.		SPF 15 Lotion -- not a great fan of it. The fragrance is way too strong for me. I don't use it.		I wish they sold more bottles of JUST 2.5% lotion at a cheaper price."

Much to my surprise, it worked!! Within a couple of days my face started to clear up! Every time I used it, my face felt clean and soft! I love it! Now Im in panic mode because I cant seem to find it anywhere but online!! Salicyclic acid alone doesnt do the trick, I actually think it makes it worse, but with this system, my face clears up!

I usually do not wear makeup and I was so self conscious that I went out and bought some. It just made it worse. I tried multiple products with very little results including proactiv. I was getting very frustrated untill I came across the neutrogena system online. It had really good reviews so I figured it was worth a try. It was sold out online so I hit my local drug store. To my surprise it was sold out everywhere I went. I tried about 4 stores in my area and no one had it in stock. I thought this stuff has to be great to be sold out everywhere. I hit the internet and found it in stock at the walgreens about 15-20 minutes away. I picked it after work on a Tuesday night and began to use it immediately. I was shocked at the results come Friday. The acne on my forehead was about 75% better. What I had left was bearly noticable. The redness was gone and my skin was surprising soft. I was so thankful for the results that I went that weekend and bought another kit because I was scared I wouldnt be able to find it again.

I didn't do this for the first month I had this kit and I kept getting fakes. So waiting 1-2 minutes between applying the lotions prevents flakiness!

B000EPA4FW,2009,5,5.0,2,2,119,"Thanks Amazon Users for Your Review on this Product!  I love it!","I read the reviews of this product and rushed out to purchase it to give it a try.  I'm in my thirties and just recently was having problems with acne.  I was washing my face daily and in spite of all of my efforts, I repeatedly was dealing with break out after break out.  It was driving me nuts.  Out of desperation I checked Amazon and found this product.  I rushed out and bought it from Target, and two weeks into using this product I couldn't be happier.  My skin looks better and better with each day of using it.  It's simple to use, and I couldn't be happier with the results.  I would highly recommend it to anyone."
B000EPA4FW,2009,2,5.0,2,2,100,"Best product I have ever used.","I am 37 years old and I have had acne since the age of 12.  During those 25 years I was unable to find a product that worked this well.  At one time I did consult with a Dermatologist but when I left my job to go to Law School that option was simply too expensive.  I searched for 2 years to find a product that would come close to what I experienced with the prescription products and this one, without a doubt, meets or even exceeds the results I had with the prescription lotions.  I highly recommend this product!"
B000EPA4FW,2009,2,5.0,2,2,360,"Actually works.... pretty fast too!","I'm 24 and I've had acne of varying severity since I was about 12.  I've tried many different treatments over the years, and while I've never suffered from extremely severe acne, I just can't remember a time when I went more than one day without at least one or two zits... and usually I had more. I was affected mostly in my T-zone, but I also have really sensitive skin, so often it felt as though the acne medications I'd try would only make things worse!	I came across this system and figured it was worth a shot... it's only $20 and you don't have to sign up for any monthly plan like you do with Proactiv.  And... it really works!!  My boyfriend and I are both shocked by how great it's been working.  Every morning, I wake up expecting a new breakout, just like I used to get. But every morning I wake up and it's just clear skin!	I began using the system about 3 weeks ago, and I'd say for about the first week I wasn't sure how it was going.  My skin seemed to get a bit more sensitive, and my cheeks (where I don't have acne, but where I was still using the cleanser) became really dry and a bit red.  I started applying the benzoyl peroxide cream every other night, and only using the cleanser in the morning, using a gentle cleanser (cetaphil) in the evening instead.  I figured that at night the benzoyl peroxide could work while the cleanser in the morning could help during the day?  After a few days of changing my routine like this, my skin calmed down again, only with fewer pimples!  I continued that way for another week, and now I'm still using the cleanser only once a day (morning) but I'm using the benzoyl peroxide night cream every night.  It's now been about two weeks since I've had a major zit (I have gotten about 2 very small ones, but they went away within a day.. I'll take it!!).	Anyway... who knows what will work for someone else, but this product was like a miracle for me."
B000EPA4FW,2008,11,5.0,2,2,152,"Simply wonderful","I am a former pro active consumer. Note that I say former, because I have found the perfect replacement! I have medium tan skin with occasional Nodular Acne breakouts. Those are the hard extremely painful large bumps under the skins surface. The fact that this treatment system is helping heal such a stubborn type of acne for less than 20 bucks is amazing. As others mentioned it does get your skin a little dry, but what acne medication doesn't?	Not only does it successfully cure stubborn acne within a week but also makes my skin glow and look radiant like it never has before, thanks to the cleanser that does a thorough job at removing dead skin cells. But you have to make sure you massage it in gently for a good 3-4 minutes on all of your face to get impressive results. Oh and NEVER leave your home without applying sunscreen!"
B000EPA4FW,2008,6,5.0,2,2,113,"No more blackheads!","This is a fantastic cleanser.  I also love the day cream.  The night cream caused me to break out in hives.  So I no longer use the night cream and gave it to my teenage son, who swears by the whole system.  I used to spend a lot of money on facials to help me cope with my blackheads.  No more.  I hope this product continues being manufactured, but have my doubts as I could not find it in several drugstores and grocery stores in the Atlanta area.  In the meantime, I am buying a lot of the product, in the unlikely event that it is taken off the market for any reason."

I cannot wait until i use it some more and my face gets even clearer.  Most of all I'm so happy my mom talked me into trying it, because I was so sick of spending money on ""okay"" products.

She's tried all kinds of products and this one works the best for her, in just a matter of a few days, and it leaves her face looking smooth and fresh - not dry.  I would highly recommend this product before trying anything else."
B000EPA4FW,2007,7,4.0,1,1,185,"Pretty Impressed","I'm a 29 year old female and have had pretty good skin - up until about a year ago. Then my skin started to break out, not just in the normal spot like my chin but now on my cheeks. I tried everything, and even broke out $159 on a Zeno (which does NOT work). I was getting desperate and bought this system at Wal-Mart about 3 weeks ago. And what do you know - my skin is almost 100% clear. It did take 2 weeks for it to fully work and be effective but now my skin looks pretty darn good. And I have not experienced the extreme dryness like others. There has been some dryness but if you use a washcloth it takes it away with no issue. I highly recommend this product - especially because its much more cost effective when compared to Proactiv or other types of acne products. I gave it 4 out of 5 because it did take 2 weeks to start working. Other than that I am a very happy customer and will continue to use this product."
B000EPA4FW,2009,5,2.0,3,4,380,"This system does NOT work for me, unfortunately","Things were going very well with a different cleanser, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E96MLW"">Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, Power-Clear Scrub, 4.2-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)</a>, but I was running low on moisture lotion so I decided to buy this kit.  I figured it's Neutrogena so it must be good.  It turned out to be a big mistake.  Over the last several days I've used the face wash in this kit, and the pores on my forehead are so irritated they look like craters, and there's a red tone.  I think this formula is too powerful for my skin.		The acne control lotion (step #2 in the kit) looks sort of like moisturizer, but it's not.  It is only something you would use as needed to control breakouts.  This part is fine, and the moisture lotion with SPF is fine too.  The only problem I have is with the cleanser.  It has a gritty texture like fine sand particles.  If I had some big blemishes on my skin, that is probably the last thing I would want to put on my face.  If your skin is already broken out, why would you want to cleanse it with something that feels like an exfoliant?		For evening I like a one-step makeup removal/cleansing process, and this does not meet that need.  I prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E96MLW"">Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, Power-Clear Scrub, 4.2-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)</a>.  It is smooth, does the job well, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean...not irritated.  (And by the way, I don't consider my skin to be sensitive.)		Just as an aside, if you're looking for an entire cleansing system, I would recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBNV1Y"">Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System with Oligopeptide-10, (1 acne treatment system</a>.  I used this system and can honestly say it's the best thing I have found to date.  The only problem I had with Nature's Gate was when I ran out of the cleanser I still had a lot of the moisturizer remaining, and I didn't want to pay to buy all three products yet.  I could not find a listing for just the cleanser.		I gave this Neutrogena system two stars, rather than one, because I realize that not all of our needs will be the same, and this product may work for other people."
B000EPA4FW,2011,7,5.0,2,3,165,"Worked almost immediately - very impressed!","Ordered this for my 14-year-old daughter who experienced pretty bad breakouts two weeks before school started.  She started using it one day, and there was a noticeable improvement the next.  Two days later, her face was almost clear and her skin tone was smooth and nearly flawless.  She has finished most of the kit and we're about to order another.  The only minimal ""problem"" was that during the first week of use, the skin around her eyes got extremely dry (she didn't realize there was no need to use the treatment lotion near her eyes) but she just used extra moisturizing lotion in those dry areas and was fine.  So yes, it might dry your skin out initially (that's kind of the point), but her skin has looked great for a month, she's gotten multiple compliments from fellow students and friends, and we like these products so much we might actually do the ""subscribe"" option and have it delivered regularly so she never runs out."
B000EPA4FW,2010,2,3.0,2,3,128,"Didn't work for me as fast as they say","I used this product for 3 weeks. I saw medium results the first week which made me feel super excited; however the next 2 weeks I didn't see any improvement.	Because of this, I tried ""Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash"" and combine it with ""Nature's Cure Two Part Acne Treatment System"" and I found that these two products are incredible when used together! I saw big results the first week! Now I have been using them for almost 1 month and my face is almost clear! I only have like 4 small small pimples and before I had my forehead covered with pimples! I highly recommend you to try this combination, but of course keep in mind that what works for me might not work for you!		Good luck!"
B000EPA4FW,2008,10,3.0,2,3,239,"Does it work?","This review isn't the best to base your opinion on but... lets see the damage. Now, for me which i consider to have somewhat light acne, couldn't get rid of it, now hold on, my face isn't everyone elses that seem to work out for them but let me give you a description of what mine was and see if its anything like yours. I have average teenage acne, like the acne on the cheeks which isn't hideous or pointing at you like a gun but just light reddish spots... Not so bad right.. well might sound bad but its not really. Now the actual review (sorry for the length but I want to help) it seems to work on decreasing the amount and the size, say for example one comes out... The night one will practically disappear it the next morining if you apply the day then night. The night one for me is the ""secret"" ingrediant to this, it works real good but if you don't keep applying it, bad things happen. But overall, its good if you just have single pimples that come out and you wanna vanish them, but if you have blots of acne (like myself or stronger) might help you but I suggest you find a better one. Very good night lotion, and uhh day okay. Recommended if you really need it, but suggest to take your time to find a better one"
B000EPA4FW,2012,0,1.0,0,1,229,"Thank you Neutrogena - For burning my face!","Was on Amazon looking for ProActive and came across this Neutrogena product by chance. Read the reviews, seemed legit, so I went to my local Wal-Mart to pick it up and used it that night. The next day it looked like it was working great, the redness had gone away, swelling gone down, etc... But the NEXT day, I used the cleanser, and then the lotion without the SPF since I wasn't going out that day and five to ten minutes later my face was on FIRE! It started out with persistent itching, and then burning. But I thought it was just a sign that the product was working. Wrong! That is most definitely not the case. I found a forum online about people who've used Neutrogena products and had skin irritation like mine and worse, even been hospitalized. I plan on using the face wash as long as I can, so long as it doesn't start reacting badly as well, but the lotions, I plan to trash. Buyer beware! It will chemically burn you. I'm not sure if my skin type is the reason, but I've never been known to have overly sensitive skin, but whatever the reason, it is harming it far worse than the acne was doing. And to clarify, the burning seems to have been caused by the lotions they provide, not the cleanser itself."

This was not the case for my skin. Maybe I was sensitive to some of the ingredients in the Neutrogena system or maybe it just didn't work for me, but either way ruptions began occurring when I used it. I noticed the pores on my nose seemed to be enlarging with continued use. I found that my skin did not feel clean after using the cleanser; as if a residue were left behind. The night cream seemed to get absorbed completely but the day cream remained slightly tacky feeling like it was sitting on top of my skin. I used the system a couple of weeks assuming that maybe my skin just needed to adjust - the eruptions didn't stop. I wish this had worked as it is a fraction of the cost of Proactiv."

This neutrogena set was a really good combo and kept my face looking good, but after two weeks it started drying my skin out.  I had to incorporate stronger moisturizers to help compensate, and my face broke out in the process.  I have very sensitive skin that dries out easily.  I don't think I would suggest this set to people who have a problem with benzoyl perozide because my face had the same reaction to that."

I tend to live with a migrating breakout that travels around my face perpetually.  I won't say that this system has cured it but a drastic impact has been made.  My breakouts are gone MUCH faster and they don't seem to spread as much anymore.  I have even enjoyed a month or two of completely clear skin. Something that, if you are afflicted with adult acne, is a game changer. Subscribing on Amazon is by far the best way to purchase this product as it is often 7 to 10 dollars cheaper than can be found in my local stores.  Be careful with the use of the acne control lotion that goes fast and first.  With a little practice I am able to make it last a month to six weeks using it twice a day. Do not, however, under any circumstances run out of this stuff once you start to use it regularly.  All hell will break out on your face.  This stuff requires a commitment of 16 or so dollars a month for, presumably, the rest of your life.  Not a bad trade off for skin that doesn't make you want to die when you look in the mirror.  Side note: Examine your peanut intake.  I gave up peanuts and the result was immediate. I'm not a doctor, just a dude telling you what has worked for me."

I've tried CVS brand acne cleanser, it did nothing but causing my skin to be flaky so I returned it; days later, after some diligent research, I decided to try out this system, it contains two different medications, so I thought I would be saved. But it's been almost a week, no old acne ever wanted to go away while new ones still kept on growing just like before, now my face is all red, irritating and flaky with totally zero results. I guess my acne must be hormone related, if so, cleanser that's supposed to kill bacteria probably would not do a thing, I'd say this Neutragena's acne system may not work on adult acne that is caused by hormone changes around menopause.

My boyfriend hates the face washes with any type of ""microbeads"" for scrubbing and yet he didn't even notice these. It cleans my skin well and tightens it. I use the acne lotion, a nickle size amount, which is very thick, goes on heavy and can feel greasy, but dries up in 1-2 minutes and that heavy greasy feeling is gone. Your skin will feel ight. I have used Neutrogena acne sore pimple spot treatment on cystic pimples and then go to bed. I have noticed a substantial difference in just 10 days.

I've been using this product for a month now and I have only had a breakout at the time of the month. I really recommend using the Neutrogena intervention kit when you have NASTY breakouts because it has a high concentration of salycilic acid and it clears red spots quickly. (Doesn't do much for the inflammed pimples but it's excellent at renewing skin.) Try this at least once before moving on to other acne clearing systems.		P.S. I did find that the acne lotion was a bit small but so far Ive been using it for weeks and it hasnt finished as quickly as I expected."

When I started using Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System two things happened. 1) I didn't have any breakouts. 2) My skin never dried out. Even with the products the Doctors gave me I dried out like crazy!! But with this my acne hasn't flared up.	It's also great because now if I forget my lotion and go to a friends house and then come home and use it the next night I don't break out like I did with other things.	I think Neutrogena rocks!!!!

The selling point for me was that a young man on there said that it did not dry out his skin or make his skin red or irritated.

I am 26 and still experience at least 3 pimples on my face at a time. I have tried proactive in the past but besides the fact that I could not stand the smell of proactive, it also dried out my skin.

After trying prescription medications (I refuse to try Accutane) I decided on this product.  I didn't like the fact that Proactive was like a monthly subscription since I try to make my products last a long time. I use the day lotion daily and the night one every other night for at least 6 months and am just now running out (great deal for about $20!).  I found it has made my skin much clearer and more even toned.  I still have the occasional breakout and cyst but I am also on antibiotics (minocin) that help tame that as well.  This is by far the best overall ""system"" that I have used. It does annoy me that it is prepackaged with all three products together, but I have dealt with that.		One thing to note is that even though the cleaner has ""micro-beads"" my skin wasn't getting the exfoliation it needed and I definitely needed something to get rid of the top layer of dead skin cells. I have been using Clique's exfoliant (Apricot Scrub would be good too) which is fine as long as I don't use it more than once a week. I also noticed that the cleanser seemed to not work after a while and I rotate it with Neutrogena's Rapidly Clear cleanser and use the spot treatment for the rare breakout. I tend to have combination skin but do not have the dying out problem that other people have had.  If I do have a dry spot, Clinque's Dramatically Different Oil-free lotion is a great quick fix and doesn't make me break out.  Sounds like a lot, but no system by itself is perfect and unfortunately, you do have to experiment.  I would say it took a good month for this to make a positive impact on my skin.  When I slacked off on the regime, my skin did get worse.  You do have to keep it up."

I did not wanted to throw away the product, so I used the whole bottle, but all the time I was using it- I can say that product did not help at all, made it just worse every week... I also used Proactive in past and it did not really help...		First day I started using Neutrogena my pimples were reducing... I have been using it for two weeks now, and even if I get a pimple- I put acne lotion on it and it get better next day.

I like the day lotion with SPF very much, since I never remember to apply sun protection.  It's also a very easy regimen to follow.  I purchase masks from other sources to use once in a while, when I remember.  My skin has gotten somewhat softer with the use of this product as well.  I would definitely recommend it.

I don't have real bad acne but I constantly have a few blemishes and some bumpy patches on my forehead and cheeks that wouldn't go away. When I started using this it did irritate my skin at first because it is very drying, and kind of made my face break out in these tiny bumps all over that I could feel but not really see unless I was staring really close in the mirror. I continued to use everything (cutting back on the peroxide a bit) and by the second week the tiny bumps were gone, as well as the bumps on my forehead and cheeks that wouldn't go away before. I also started using the Advanced Solutions Acne Peel every other day and I have noticed that scars I have had forever are already fading. I am defintely breaking out less which is the best part.You just have to be careful with how drying it all is because dry skin doesn't look good either! So I have been using Aveeno Clear Complexion on top of the peroxide and day lotion if my skin is extra dry. I was debating and debating between this and Proactive but after reading some reviews the company just seemed sketchy. I'd say if your current facial products aren't cutting it (I had been using Garnier Nuctrise face wash and scrub, Olay Daily Facials and mask and toner, Philosophy, Clean and Clear, everything off the shelf!) then try this out.

I would not recommend this just because my bad experience which could happen to someone else (which I would hate), however, everyone is different and from the reviews on here, hey, you might get lucky with this.		Also: Neutrogena was very smart in making the most helpful protect of the 3 the smallest. When I was done with it I still had half my sun protection lotion and half the face wash.

Had tried many acne products and just decided to try this one out. It was quite impressive! After 3 weeks of using it, my acne breakouts reduce significantly and heal more quickly. Although my skin is not totally clean as I hope it will eventually be, I'm pretty happy about the results.	My skin is combination-type and quite sensitive to lots of things--spring season, sun burns, etc. Many anti-acne products that claim to be moderate often cause serious allergic issues like redness or even more severe acnes on my skin. For this one, I have not experienced these problems. However, it does cause my skin to be overdry a little bit--so what I do now is I combine the kit with some sensitive-skin lotion and moisturizer. For people who have relatively dry skin, I guess using the kit as a supplement rather than relying on it for moisturizing would be a better option.	--------------------------------------------	Updates: I stop using this line after 2 months. It works better at the beginning and now its effect is fading. I guess this is the problem for all acne treatment products based on benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. It is also not appropriate for long-term use on sensitive skin. I had to apply lots of Avene Spring Water to calm my skin everyday in the past few weeks.  I'm switching to more natural products now, such as tea tree oil and lavender oil."

I have tried many products from different companies and they usually work in a short term rather than a long term. The benefit of using this products is to complete system that Neutrogena offers. The cleanser does not have an overpower feminine smell. For any males who are curious trying out Neutrogena, this product is for us. It is a gel type cleanser that easily turns into foam when use moderately. This is beneficial for me because I dont want excess cream dripping into the sink while I wash my face. The cleanser absorbs most of the oil that my skin produces after I finish washing my face. The acne gel does have a slightest smell of benzoyl peroxide. When use moderately, the acne gel does not leave any white residue on my skin. Too much of the gel will leave ugly white mark on anyone skins. One of the reasons I love about this acne gel is how quickly it dries when I apply on my skin. I do not have to sit around and wait for minutes for the gel to sink into my pores and to demolish tough acne pimples. In the package, it also include a suncream protection with SPF 15. I live in a desert where my skin gets to expose toxic radiations from the sunlight. I use the suncream to protect my overall face from any radiation of the sunlight. I love about the suncream because it is oil free. Do not quote me on this statement but I think all of the products from Neutrogena are oil free. Having oily skin, this suncream allows my pores to breath. What is more special about this acne system is every box comes with a five dollars off to use at any retail stores in America. I get mine for 15 dollars and it usually last for two months. I am not going to lie but I also use other facial cleansers from Neutrogena as well as other companies because I want to make the kit last a bit longer.

I use the cleanser pretty much every day twice a day and noticed way less break-outs or big red bumps that hurt and turned into zits. I figured out that I can use this cleanser with a Neurogena sensative skin lotion with spf 15 and I can keep my face clean and fresh. I've been using it since the spring of 2012.

I guess I was hoping this could get me by until I could find a new dermatologist that gives hormone therapy instead of just traditional acne therapy. I have had pretty severe acne off and on for 9 years and have seen 3 different doctors for it only to find temporary relief from the antibiotics and topical gels they prescribed along. They mentioned Acutane too but I refused to try. About 3 years ago I began to realize that I had a hormone imbalance which made me moody and made it hard to sleep at times. I knew the birth control pill could help with acne so I went on it and it really helped with all of my hormonal issues, but it only went so far. I still have breakouts and sleep problems and decided so seek out a doctor that could address my hormonal frustrations, esp my acne. I am looking forward to getting a hormone blocker and stopping the excess oil production in my skin that contributes to my cystic acne.  Hormone therapy gets to the root of the problem rather than just treating the symptoms of acne itself. When you get your hormones under control it's more of a permanent solution unlike traditional therapy (only to have the acne return in a few weeks/months.)  I don't think I will be trying the severe acne kit Neutrogena offers either. I am tired of wasting time and money."

This stuff REALLY works! I love it! I am also using the Neutrogena Moisturizer because it kind of tends to dry my skin a little, but I'm so glad to see these zits being banished for good."
B000EPA4FW,2007,2,4.0,4,5,190,"So much better than ProActiv!","Believe it or not, this product beats ProActiv big time.  I didn't think it would since ProActiv is so popular nowadays.  I bought ProActiv a while back and it was not a pleasant experience.  My skin burned, itched, turned red.  And on top of all that, it was abnormally dry [shocking because I've never had dry skin in my life].		I desperately needed something to get rid of my acne [which was located mostly on my forhead area] ... ProActiv was terrible, as I mentioned before.  So I decided to buy Neutrogena Advanced Solutions, and this was the best decision ever.  I noticed results as soon as 2-3 days.  My acne is all gone now.		This is a great product.  Since I don't have enough time in my schedule, this product was great.  It's only 2 steps, whereas ProActiv was 3.  My skin is great right now, I love it!! I totally recommend this product.  You may be wondering why I'm giving this 4 stars, the reason is because it DID cause a bit of dry skin, but it is not severe, it went away by itself.		Overall, I'm satisfied."
B000EPA4FW,2009,6,1.0,12,17,185,"Seriously over-hyped - don't waste your money","I've tried them all. Proactiv, Clean & Clear, Neutrogena, Phisoderm, Clinique, other over-the-counter treatments, as well as prescription washes, creams, and pills. I can honestly say this is the WORST one I've ever tried. Seriously disappointed.		I used this religiously for three weeks and my acne has actually gotten worse... not one sign of improvement. And if that isn't enough, the creams are not even comfortable to put on - the night cream being the worst. It's thick and sticky and leaves your face feeling like a dried up raisin. It dries out your face and makes it tight and itchy. Seriously unpleasant. The day cream has an SPF in it, and although that sounds appealing, I feel like all that's in it is sunscreen. It smells like sunscreen and makes my face extremely oily. The general face was is okay but leaves a bit of buildup unless you spend five minutes rinsing.		So please... read all of the reviews here and make the decision for yourself. Everyone's skin is different, but at least take this review under consideration. It's a serious waste of mulah!"

And as I said, I'm not sure if it actually did anything for the acne because I had to stop using it after one week and up until then I could not see any significant changes. Aside from redness and burning!"
B000EPA4FW,2013,0,5.0,1,1,123,"Worked wonders for my 13 year old daughter","I was hoping this product would help my teenage daughter with early on set acne - and it did! She has sensitive skin and after trying proactiv when I was younger and experiencing tons of dryness, I was weary of letting my daughter try it. I read about Neutrogena Acne System and thought I would give it a try! So glad I did - completely cleared up her skin within 1 week - noticeable difference in 2/3 days. Only complaint is that 1oz lotion sizes run out way too fast, wished it was same size as cleanser. Also, bought Neutrogena toner on the side (proactiv comes with a toner) for her to use. 5 Star product that I will purchase again and again!!!"
B000EPA4FW,2012,11,4.0,1,1,64,"works quickly, dries out skin","I purchased this kit for my teenage daughter who suddenly developed a bit of acne at the age of 15. I'm thinking it's a  hormone surge.

Four stars as opposed to five is for the drying factor but I'm thinking it wouldn't work otherwise."

B000EPA4FW,2012,9,5.0,1,1,80,"It works!","I was hesitant to purchase this set, due to some negative reviews. However, I am so glad I did. I have mild adult acne, and it is very embarassing. Previously, I tried Proactiv, Clerasil, and pretty much every possible OTC acne product, and have never been impressed. I purchased this product, and in the past 2 month of using it, I have not had a single bump! I feel much more confident and happy. This product is worth every penny."
B000EPA4FW,2012,8,5.0,1,1,306,"I LOVE this stuff","Let me first say I've struggled with breakouts since the age of 15. I'm now 29, and I still break out. I have ups and downs, and after going through my first pregnancy, then breastfeeding for a year, starting a new birth control, my hormones have been all over the place the past 2+ years and my skin was suffering. Now, I tried Proactiv (again) because I had had great luck with it in my early 20's. However, I seemed to have built up a tolerance to it so quit using it at about age 24-25. This time it SERIOUSLY irritated my skin. It was red, it hurt, it was tight and dry. I used it every other day, as recommended, and after 3 weeks my skin was worse than ever. Mind you, this was all happening at the same time I had started taking Loestrin Fe for the first time. So, that could have been a factor as well. It was hard to know what was causing the flare-up, but Proactiv made it SO much worse. But, all I know is that I ordered this stuff and within 5 days my skin felt and looked WAY better. I have been using it for about 6 months now and love it. It's not a miracle worker, I don't have 100% perfect skin, but I know I never will. But it is considerably better, and when I do get breakouts (still hormone-related, as it's always during ""that time of the month"") it's not bad at all. Bottom line: it is effective w/out being so harsh on your skin like Proactiv. I am buying more of it, I love it. I would highly recommend you try this if you've tried other methods, have stubborn breakouts, and have found Proactiv either too harsh or that it loses its effectiveness."
B000EPA4FW,2012,8,4.0,71,72,261,"Controls my breakouts","To me, nothing is more embarrassing than skin breakouts. They always seem to come at the worst time for me. I would have an interview or a start a new job or have a date the next day and it would never fail, I'd wake up with the breakouts. I went to a few skin doctors who said I was probably experiencing some type of hormonal imbalances. Like pretty much everyone else writing these reviews for the various acne products they've tried, nothing I was doing was making any headway even though I had read all the books and used every pill, cream, and scrub. I have tried a little bit of mixing and matching and I'm having much better results. I used the Neutrogena to get rid of the greasy skin and facial acne and used an acne supplement <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LJ0ZK6"">ClearZine (2 Bottles) - The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill. Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits</a> to stop the breakouts from happening. I used the Neutrogena system once in the morning when I woke up and once at night before I went to bed and took 3 capsules of the Clearzine twice each day .Within two weeks I was able to get rid of my acne, stop my breakouts and stop the greasy feeling of my skin. So far it's been a month and no breakouts at all and my skin looks amazing. Not sure if this combo will work for everyone, you may need to be doing a little experimenting of your own but it works perfectly for me."
B000EPA4FW,2007,4,5.0,63,64,221,"Works very well for me, *personally*","First off, I'm in my early 20's and have combination type skin with occasional, mild to moderate acne.  I used nearly two whole ProActiv systems before switching to a Neutrogena kit and have found that this clears up my skin much better and faster.  I find it very convenient that the Day Lotion includes SPF 15, whereas the ProActiv Repairing Lotion doesn't, even though ProActiv advises you to use sunscreen with their system when going outside.  That would probably prompt you to buy their oil-free moisturizer with SPF 15 as well ($$ smart business move $$), thus adding another step to your skin-care regimen.  I would recommend anyone with my acne/skin type who is thinking about subscribing to ProActiv to try Neutrogena first.		Anyway, the Neutrogena kit lasts around 5 months for me.  I still get an occasional zit or two, but with less frequency than I did in the past.  I use a Neutrogena Rapid Clear spot gel for that with success.		Word of advice: It might be best if you shake the tube of acne cleanser before you start using it.  When I was finishing up what was left of the last tube I used, I discovered that all the ""micro-fine beads"" were gathered there, afloat at the very top somehow.  I've been wondering where those were all along..."
B000EPA4FW,2007,3,5.0,54,55,107,"Finally, help for adult acne!!","I am in my early 30's and have been experiencing severe and embarassing break-outs along my jaw line, chin and cheeks for the past couple of years.  I have tried Murad, Proactiv, AcneFree and many other systems without success.		A month ago I picked up the Neutrogena system when I saw it on sale. Within five days days my skin started to clear.  Now, I have a completely clear complexion and have not had a single break-out since starting the system. I have had no problems with drying and my skin is much softer than before.  Finally, a product that works and comes at a decent price!"
B000EPA4FW,2007,4,5.0,42,44,261,"Works great for me","First of all, I understand that not every product will work for every individual.  But, this one is far exceeding my expectations.  I did some research online before I bought this.  What I found was that what seemed to work the best for people was a combination of salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.  I looked at the wide array of acne treatments I had at home and they were ALL salicylic acid, but no benzoyl peroxide.  I thought it was worth a shot.		I'm 35 and acne runs in my family.  My mom still has it.  I was starting to develop very deep, painful acne that would heal in one place and then show up in another place.  Nothing I was doing was getting rid of it.  I found this Neutrogena system and I noticed some improvement the very next day.  I'm a little over a week into it now and I can't believe the improvement!  I'm going to recommend this product to anyone I know who battles with acne, like I did.		Realistically, I know I'll probably still have the occasional breakout.  But this worked wonders on the constant problems I was experiencing before.  One of the things I REALLY like about this, is it's only 2 steps.  Wash and moisturize/protect.  I don't have the time or the patience for a whole routine with various products.  I love that I just have to wash and apply cream.  Overall I think this is a wonderful product and half the price of Proactiv (which I understand is a 3 step process anyway)."
B000EPA4FW,2008,4,5.0,22,22,545,"Better than Proactive and ALL of the prescriptions I've tried...","I'm 29 and NEVER even had so much as a tiny pimple anywhere...until I got pregnant.  My daughter is now 3 and I've been struggling with acne ever since.  I get large, deep, cystic acne on my chin and sometimes on my forehead, and tiny, puss filled pimples on my neck, chest and back.  I have tried Proactive for months on end with far less results than were worth the time and effort of all the steps involved (and the price).  I have tried a variety of precriptions for washes and ointments/foams/creams from my dermatologist including Benzaclyin, Evoclin, Tazarac Cream, Clenia, and Zyiana.  Some dried my skin out so badly that it actually cracked and was very painful, some didn't dry the pimples out enough, and some would clear up breakouts, but not prevent future outbreaks. None of them came with a moisturizer, so I never knew how to fight off the dryness.  I was always afraid that using a drugstore moisturizer would defeat the effects of the meds by clogging my pores and causing more breakouts, so I'd just suffer with uncomfortable and ugly flaking skin in hopes that the acne would atleast stop.  No such luck.		I have been using the Neutrogena system for about 2 weeks, and I can confidently say that this is going to be the LAST acne regimin I will ever follow again.  When I bought the set at Target, it came with a free bottle of the spot treatment, which I think is vital to the success of this system.  Within a few days, I noticed that the tiny pimples on my chest were drying out and no new pimples were forming anywhere.  Now, almost all of the pimples - even the deep ones on my chin - are either gone, or DRAMITICALLY reduced.  I will also add that I started this system about 12 days before I expected my period knowing that the worst pimples of the month were on their way. I did experience a bit of drying, but nothing that was at all painful or really red and irritated.  The best thing about this system is that it comes with a daytime moisturizer, so your skin will never be cracking and flaking the way it would with other treatements.  The slight drying was actually beneficial for me because I have olive skin, and I get hyperpigmentation (dark marks) where pimples were.  They normally take several weeks to fade, but the drying effect of the nightime acne lotion helped to really exfoliate those spots and the result has been a dramatic lightening of those marks.		I would definately recommend giving this system a try.  Get the spot treatment as well.  I started out using the wash and night time acne lotion as well as the spot treatment at night, and then the wash and moisturizer during the day.  Now that most of the pimples have cleared up, I'm not using the spot treatment.  There are so few steps to this system - it's not time consuming or tedius to keep up with.  It's affordable (the bottles are large enough to last over a month even if you're using them on your back, chest and face as I am), it's quick, easy, and most of all, effective."
B000EPA4FW,2007,8,5.0,15,15,254,"Wow!  It really does work!","I am in my 30's and have adult onset acne.  I have been using a prescription	Retin A and prescription bleaching cream (for the red scars) for the past 2 years.  They have helped some, but recently my face broke out severely, even while using the Rx products.  I was about to order Proactive, but decided to pick up this Neutrogena system at the local drug store because I wanted help NOW! I could tell a difference on the second morning!  Not huge, but progress.  By morning three, my face was tremendously better and i noticed that there were NO new knots brewing.  I am a little flaky in places, but i'll just pump up the moisturizer a little tomorrow.  DEFINATELY worth it for a quick fix.	....	I now have been using this product for 2 months.  I love it.  I have even been through 2 ""cycles"" and didn't have the usual outburst of acne that normally comes a week prior to the event.  My face is more clear than it's been in years.  I must warn you that this product will bleach!  My pillow cases are all ruined, but it's well worth it!  Just use an old pillow case or buy white!	This one kit has lasted me for 2 months and I still have some left.  I have used it every day, twice a day with very few exceptions.  I think it will get me through a 3rd month before I have to purchase again.  I will DEFINATELY buy this again!"
B000EPA4FW,2006,10,5.0,16,17,155,Great!,"This is the best affordable acne solution that ive ever used. I had acne on my forehead and the acne started to get smaller and even the acne on my cheeks just disappeared the next morning. On the box there is a sticker that said that it works faster than proactiv solution and its right! Proactiv takes like 2 weeks to work but this works over night. The only minor thing about it is when you put on the overnight acne control lotion, it starts feeling like its harding into a mask on your face. It feels like its restricing muscle movement on your face. Its no biggy because it works and it washes right off in the morning when im in the shower. I cant believe a little lotion can make such a difference. If you are looking for acne solution at a affordable price then this is exacly what you are looking for."
B000EPA4FW,2008,6,5.0,10,10,87,"LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!","My teenage kids absolutely LOVE this product!		After we saw the commercial, my kids wanted to give it a try.  ProActiv didn't work well for them and I found it to be too expensive.		They've been using the Neutrogena product for about a week now.  They've had NO NEW BREAKOUTS.  My son especially likes the moisturizer because he used to really get dry skin.		If the commercial is an indication of what my kids have to look forward to, we'll be die-hard Neutrogena users for life!  :-)"
B000EPA4FW,2007,5,5.0,10,10,159,"Very Pleasantly Surprised","I was skeptical at first if this product line would really do the job the same or better than Proactive. The amounts of medication used are less than what's contained in the ""extra strength"" Proactive I'd been using, but which left me with skin so dry I would only apply once a day.		I'm really happy I decided to purchase this line when I saw it in the store (convenient and half the price). The cleanser is where you get the salicylic acid and very small gentle beads, the night lotion is where you get the benzoyl peroxide, and the day lotion is included for a nice oil-free spf 15 moisturizer.		The overall results are much better than my old regimen. I have clearer skin with much less drying, and I don't have to go through the extra steps of applying an added moisturizer and sunscreen like I used to. I recommend this gentle and effective product, great all-around."

I ran out of Proactiv and when I started breaking out, I wanted to rush and buy Proactiv but I hesitated because Proactiv is expensive and although it works, I hate that it makes my skin really sensitive and it takes weeks to see results. I saw Neutrogena Advanced Solutions at Target and instead of ordering Proactiv I wanted to try it and plus it's half the price of Proactiv. The label said it works better than Proactiv and it's absolutely true! I saw results overnight after using it. The skin polishing acne cleanser made my face feel soft after washing it. I do have to agree with the other reviewer that the night lotion does make your face feel like a hard mask, but it's because it contains benzoyl peroxide. They give you a SPF 15 lotion so you don't have to buy a face sunscreen. It's a great package and it smells better than Proactiv."

What happened was I was sweating and the sweat carried the product to my shirts and bleached them. I looked all over each tube and could't find any warning about bleaching.  I'm guessing it's the acne control lotion because the active ingredient sounds like it would bleach. Also my eye brows are almost white now.		I thought I was saving money until it ruined my 2 favorite shirts which I will never be able to replace and those cost me over 50 dollars.  From now on I'll stick to lab series products."

First off, I dislike this product very much. AcneFree was very effective in removing the acne, but it just about removed the entire top layer of my facial skin along with it! This Neutrogena line is highly inneffective. The face wash is SO thick, that when you squeeze it into your hands it comes out in a solid ball of product. Rubbing the hands together to liquify it is futile. Secondly, there is a day face lotion. What is the purpose of this? This product contains so little salicylic acid that I could not imagine it drying the skin out. Replace that with a toner, please. Lastly, there is a nighttime treatment. It works a little, and is more convenient than the other products... but I just will not be buying this again. Maybe other products from Neutrogena are great; but this one was a mistake for me to purchase."

This would mostly include my eye area and around/on the sides of my lips (where I tend to have very dry patches of skin).	I don't know what ingredients may have caused this, but it's been very gradual and I just recently noticed the lighter areas of my face.  There are no other products I continually use in the same places like I've used this product, or for how long of a time period that I've used this product, so I'm sure that this is the reason for it.  Since it was very gradual, though, I would say it is probably safe to use this product for a lesser time period (probably less than a year) or less regularly (I used to use it every night).	I've found that some great substitutes to this product are A&D ointment, which I believe is Johnson & Johnson brand, or just plain old Vaseline.

It kind of smells like &#34;pennies&#34; or &#34;old lady&#34; as my boyfriend would say.  But it doesn't bother me and it wasn't bad enough to knock off one star.  But that's it for a &#34;negative&#34; issue...	Now, for the good stuff!  I am a health care worker and this product saves my hands.  I wash my hands at least 50 times a shift and when I get home they were very dry and cracked and sometimes painful.  I began using this product at night about a year ago and recently began to use it in the mornings as well.  I have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin through-out the day even with the continuous washings.  I have even started using it on my feet, but it hasn't been long enough to tell a significant long term difference (only about a week and in winter and not EVERY DAY...the TRUE test will be in summer when I break out my sandals!), but the short term is VERY nice!	I have small hands (I wear XS exam gloves or little girl gloves) and I use about a nickel size amount each time.  One tube has lasted me about one year give or take a few days and that's just my hands.  It will probably go faster now that I am using it on my feet, but it's worth it.  If anyone has ever used Aquaphor the consistency is very similar but this absorbs faster in my opinion and even if you wash your hands right after applying it, they still stay soft.  Of course, I would recommend allowing your hands to completely absorb it before washing them if you can.  While it leave a small greasy residue directly after applying (and that is based on the amount you apply and how long you rub it in) it quickly absorbs into the skin leaving your hands very soft!"

It does say it is for extremely dry skin, but I had no idea it would be more like a gel than a cream. I put it on my face last night and felt like I had just rubbed Crisco on it. Personally, I do not like it, but if you are looking at this product and want an extremely thick greasy gel for your face, it may work for you.

It doesn't prevent the shine we oilers get a few hours into the day, but it does prevent flaky skin in the winter, and moisturizes well.  Does not feel heavy at all either.		For reference I have used Aveeno (several versions including age-defense), Jack Black daily (not the oil control, which is good for spot treatment but a terrible idea as an every day face lotion), Oil of Olay rejuvenate and Clinique Men M lotion.  The original aveeno age defense was my favorite but they changed it and messed it up completely.  Won't go back.  Oil of Olay has a great feel but brings out my oils a little more around mid-day.  Jack Black is good, but only good in the moisturizing and oil mitigations categories, the two I care most about.		This product and Clinique are probably tied right now, and this one gives more bang for the buck, so I will continue using it, maybe switching off every few bottles to compare.  M lotion seems to be equal in moisture, slightly less efficient at preventing the oil at mid-day, and slightly better frangrance, which brings me to the only knock, and the reason for the 4 star rating.  Dermalogica has a slightly medicinal smell when applying.  I have never gotten a whiff of it after it's on, but it's not scented, which may be a good thing if you are looking for a more pure product.  Anyway until someone tells me my face smells funny, I will continue to use Dermalogica with confidence."

It is light weight so it does not create excess oil and moisturizes so I do not get dry spots.  It is great in the morning before I apply a little powder and blush.

Most of the Dermalogica line I use is with the mediBac Clearing line - but I wanted something that had a little more moisturizing abilities.  This lotion is a good moisturizer that dries quickly and leaves skin feeling not oily.  There is an odor to the product that causes me to hold my breath when applying- the smell reminds me of a cleaning product - I think they were going for something that smelled herbal but missed the mark slightly.  The odor only last a moment and once lotion is dry is gone all together.  I follow up with the mattifier in the T-Zone when I know that I'm going to have a long day and shine is a concern.  Make up goes on nicely after this product.  Yes the product is pricey- I can't lie and say that I use less of this item than of any other face lotion -but I will buy again since it works well and does not cause any excess oils or acne problems."

She swears by their stuff so I thought I'd give it a try.  The Active Moist moisturizer was recommended to me as a light moisturizer that would be good for my sometimes acne irritated skin as it wouldn't leave my face feeling oily or greasy and it was sensitive enough not to irritate my mild acne. I absolutely loved the light feeling and knowing that it was giving my face the moisture it needed, I didn't feel the need to reapply. My skin felt really soft after continuous use, so I've now added Demalogica Active Moist moisturizer to my regular beauty regime.

B000PKYC68,2012,3,5.0,1,2,287,"It has finally happened!","After years of searching I have found the perfect moisturizer for my crazy sensitive combination face. I know the Dermalogica website recommends having your face mapped to pick the right products for you but I had a gift card and this moisturizer got really good reviews so I figured I would give it a shot.		First and foremost it has a nice, light smell. It's not overly chemical nor is it overly fruity/musky/earthy. It's barely noticeable when you first apply it.	Second, it may be a bit pricey but a little truly goes a long way. I use a penny to nickel sized amount(depending on the oily patch to dry skin ratio)I got a 3.4 oz tube about a month ago and the end is no where in sight.	Third, it's just heavy enough to really feel like your skin is getting nice and moisturized but just light enough to leave a soft and smooth finish. Best of all it doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky or greasy.		I have very weird skin. It's sensitive and prone to redness so a lot of products are too harsh. I tend to buy natural based products because they are free of the chemicals that really irritate my skin BUT I often find they don't clean as well and I end up with a lot of acne in my T zone.	The sides of my forehead, nose and cheek line are prone to dryness and sometimes flaking. So it's really hard finding a product that combats oiliness, dryness, prevents irritation, keeps my skin moisturized, AND doesn't make me break out. Despite the price I will definitely be sticking with this product and I look forward to trying other Dermalogica products."

However, the one I purchased here on Amazon had a different texture and consistency, it was very runny and not as thick as the one I bought from Ulta.

I was first introduced to Dermalogica in a salon, and I loved it so much, I decided to pay the higher price for it. I use the Active Moist shown here, the Skin Clearing Wash and the Skin Prep Scrub. The cleanser is very mild, but it does a decent job mitigating the acne (although it doesn't prevent it entirely). The moisturizer is not too heavy, absorbs well, and does a good job keeping my skin soft. I never observe any dryness or flakiness on my face. The scrub feels nice, but I don't notice as significant a difference in my skin for better or worse when I use it. I suspect if I went without for awhile, I'd notice.

I have to be cautious with the products I use on my face because I am prone to breaking out very easily.  After using it moisturizes my face without an oily feeling and doesn't create pumps on my face.  It is just the right amount of moisture for my face.		Before this I used to use a moisturizer with spf made in Australia, but my face seemed oily and after awhile I started to notice pumps on my face.  The only thing is that it doesn't have spf included, but for spf I use Eucerin Sensitive (recommended by my dermatologist) on top of the active moist and I am good to go.  With both I do not get an oily feeling.  I do feel that this is pricey, but if you can find on amazon at $30 for 3.4 fl oz. then that is a deal.

I'm 27 and sick of having mild to moderate acne but when I use this product it definitely improves. I use it once every night and in about 2 weeks I saw a big difference.

I can now use it every night with only a little bit of stingy sensation, but its definitely worth it. I started using it last year and got compliments all the time, when I ran out I didn't order another pot and my skin definitely lost its glow. So I ordered another pot recently and it's now improved back to where it was, maybe even better. I also use a salicylic face wash by burt's bees which also seems to help.

Have been trying it for one month so it's too soon to formulate an opinion.  However, I do like the glow on my skin though.  My husband had a tingling sensation in the beginning and didn't really care for it but he persisted and the tingling is now gone and he seems to like it as much as the high end name brand.

I'm 35 and just started noticing slight wrinkles on my forehead, around the eyes and between my eyebrows. After doing some research, I figured I give this product a shot, especially since it's so inexpensive and seems to have great reviews. I got my jar on Friday, and even though the instructions say only used it 3 times per week if you're not used to using glycolid acid, I used it on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I should have listened to the direction... today, I woke up with a little redness on my face, but nothing major. I applied some powder and you can't even tell. I also noticed a little peeling on my forehead, but if you're not looking very close, you can't tell. My fault, I should know how to follow directions by now.		I'm writing this so you'll be smarter and do as you're told on the packaging. After 3 days of use, my little wrinkles are GONE. My skin is soft, and looks like it did in my early twenties. The deeper ones are still there, but I'm sure once I start using the cream as I'm supposed to, those will fade too. I'm so happy that I got this cream. I'm thinking about stocking up. It does burn a little when you apply, but it's not unbearable and once you put a little regular moisturizer on top, the burning subsides. I'm a rookie on the anti-aging beauty market, but I couldn't be happier with this purchase, and especially at this price."

B00016R5IS,2012,7,5.0,2,2,307,amazing,"I've been using this cream for about 2months and results are amazing.  I absolutely love it.  When I first started using it, it burned my face and my face broke out.  That is because it says to use 3 times a week.  I was also using my vitamin c homemade serum and the reaction was horrible.  If you use this cream, dont exfoliate your face with scrubs or any kind of vitamin c serum. They don't mix well and you will have worst skin than what you started off with. After a few tries I finally got it down to a science because I have extra super sensitive skin.  I started off using it twice a week every other day.  Inbetween the days I was using the glycolic cream, I didnt use my facial scrubs or vitamin c serum, I just washed my face and washed my face gently.  The results were amazing.  It took atleast 5years off my face no joke.  The deep indentations you get by your nose because of the aging process is now gone and my face looks all plumped up.  I still use my vitamin c serum and face scrub but I give my face a few days rest after I have used the glycolic acid.  It takes away the fine lines under your eyes aswell.  I have now increased it to 3 times a week, but ONLY every other day. Your face really has to adjust to it, especially if you have never used glycolic acid before or have sensitive skin.  Remember NO EXFOLIATING during use of this product because it is an exfoliator all by itself.  This is now  a life long product and will continue to purchase because my skin is absolutely beautiful now.  Even as a teenager my skin wasnt this smooth and clear.  I highly recomend this."

How many times have I walked past this item at health food stores without a second thought.  So finally, I have been divinely lead to this product, surely at the approprpriate time for my skin to handle the product.  Well, let me just say ""FABULOUS"".  It has been 3 weeks of continued nightly use of this product and my skin is luminous, my fine smile lines are almost completely gone, my pores on my cheeks that I thought would never close, are tightening and closing, and old belemishes are fading.

I find my skin is smoother and I have fewer breakouts (a phenomenon which started happening when I hit 40 - go figure!) Anyway, after using it again at night for just a week, once again my skin is glowing. Its also great to fade acne scars and blemishes. I am a person of color whose skin discolors easily, which means if I get a pimple and pop it, I'll have a scar for several months to follow. With this cream my skin stays clear and when a blemish does show up, it heals and fades quicker. Glycolic acids can burn initially so I would recommend using their 5% cream first before this 10% cream if your skin isn't used to alpha hydroxy acids and glycolic acid creams."

For those of you trying glycolics for the first time, you might experience stinging and itching. Have a cup of water with a tablespoon of Baking soda dissolved in it to wash off the glycolics and neutralize the acid (alkaline balances acid). Don't use this every night at first. try it once every few nights until your skin gets used to it. you can also try it for a short while then wash it off, extending the time it is on.

(I did test it on my forearm just to make sure, then on my neck) I use it every other night whenever I feel like my skin is getting a little dull. It says it's for mature skin, but I am 21, oily/acne prone skin and wanted to get rid of acne/acne marks and this has totally helped!	If it stings a little bit, you can add a light moisturizer over it once it is applied. It is for night use only.	I have already recommended this to my friend who also is an acne sufferer.

Mind you I've only had it four days, but in FOUR DAYS I've seen a dramatic improvement in my skin!  About my skin?  Blotchy from sun damage and acne scars.  It's been horrible having to deal with all this after living 30+ years with great skin.  Suddenly it all changed in my 30's and I was dealing with adult acne and then hyperpigmentation from skin over-exposure.  Ugh.  I hated wearing all that concealer and face make-up but had to!  I also refused to spend hundreds if not thousands on laser treatments, etc.  For me that was just submitting to being gouged by a greedy industry.  So for the past few years I've tried various products promising this and that.  None of them ever made a real difference...until this cream!  Like I said: OMG.  I am thrilled!  And if this is what happens after only a few days I can't wait to see what happens over the coming weeks.  My skin is brighter, the scars are diminshing and the texture is sublime!  It truly feels like magic in a jar.  If I'm dreaming, please don't wake me.  Wow.  Btw this cream did not sting me at all.  I felt a minor sensation for about 10 seconds and then nothing.  But that's just my experience.  I know some people claim it does sting, so be very careful about not using this cream with open pores until you know your own skin sensitivities.  I wish you all equal or better results!"
B00016R5IS,2011,3,5.0,30,30,332,"Clearer complexion, even with sensitive skin","I love this cream.  It doesn't have any parabens, propylene glycol, bht, or alcohol.  This was great for me since I am trying to discontinue the consumption/use of food and skin care products with ingredients that have alleged health risks or that are known carcinogens. In addition, I have extremely sensitive skin and some products cause me to have allergic reactions or breakouts.  But that's not the case with this brand of glycolic acid. Please keep in mind that I've used higher concentrations of glycolic acid in the past to remove dark spots from some of those allergic reactions. If you've never used glycolic acid cream or had an acid peel before, I'd recommend starting with a lower concentration and expect initial irritation when you first start using the product.  This cream keeps my skin smooth and clear, and it practically eliminates breakouts. In addition, I recently started using 100% pure african black soap to cleanse my skin, which has enhanced my skin's appearance even more.  Another bonus is when I ordered this cream from Amazon, I got it $10 cheaper than in-store at Ulta or any online retailer.		Update 09/01/2012: I'm still using this cream and still loving it.  I just wanted to share an organic face wash that is awesome.  It's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AM7BQ"">Juice Beauty Green Apple Cleansing Gel</a>.  But it's pricey (around $30 at Amazon or Ulta). I'll use the apple gel wash at night and the african soap in the morning. Also, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001428W6W"">Desert Essence - 100% Pure Jojoba oil 4 oz liquid</a> is the ONLY moisturizer I will use because I can drench my face in this stuff without it causing any acne or allergic reactions. I am continuously finding that the more natural and organic a product is (whether for skin, food, or house hold cleaning), the less likely I am to have allergic reactions. Plus, I just found out I'm pregnant and I don't have to worry about eliminating products that are unsafe for the fetus."

This stuff cleared my pores out in no time and after the pores were clear they started to shrink. It also helps to clear up and dry up acne pimples(the ones on my forehead are gone, gone, gone after only a week). My laugh lines are virtually none existent now too. I used it before bedtime and couldn't wait to get up and look in the mirror every morning.		The only reason I give this a four stars is that it makes my skin so greasy and I already have oily skin. I have learned my lesson to read the ingredients though before I buy and I see that this has added oils in it. I have found that I can get oil free glycolic acid (Yay!!), so that is my goal.		I do recommend this product for women who have normal to dry skin though. I didn't find that it burned a lot, but I had already been using a glycolic acid product. It just tingled a little even when I washed my face before I used it there was virtually no burn. If it weren't for the oil in it (or if I didn't have oily skin) I'd say this is a girl's best friend."

I'm not a skeptic by nature, but I am with too-good-to-be-true reviews. But this cream is TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE! I used one complete 1.5 oz container. It's been roughly 3-4 months I have NOT used this product. And I can tell!!! I will reorder this week. When I use it, my already pale skin appears ""whiter."" I read the ingredients several times to see if it had bleach! My face glows! I'm in my mid-30s, so the lines are creeping in. This really helps with the lines! I DID have a stinging sensation when I put it on. I found, for me, that happened when my skin was ""dry."" Therefore, I applied it with a moisturizer, or mostly I put my moisturizer on after. The stinging stopped. The stinging also lessened after my skin grew accustomed to the product. I did NOT have a greasy affect, if anything, I worried it might dry my already dry skin. As stated, I applied my moisturizer after I applied this. I used this cream roughly 3-4 times a week. Some weeks more. I even used it during the day (if I had not used it the night before) if I needed the extra glow when I had a speaking engagement, etc. I gave it 5 Stars because I could not give it 10."
B00016R5IS,2011,8,5.0,10,10,178,"The ONLY thing I will ever use!!!","If you haven't used this product before, start with the 5% cream & use it every other night, then work up to nightly for a month or so, then move up to the 10%.  Trust me, you can go to any major beauty store, pay tons of money on stuff that movie stars endorse, but NOTHING compares to this.  PERIOD.		I got hooked on glycolic acid about 12 years ago, in my thirties, when I started getting adult onset acne.  This stuff really took care of it, and I have not used anything else since.  I have tried other acid products, including prescription ones, but nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to this product.  I not only use it on my face, but also my neck, throat and decolletage.  I go get facials about once a month at my dermatologist for sun damage (I live in Texas - not enough sunscreen in the world), and the technicians there are always amazed at how great my skin looks. My only complaint is that they don't sell it in a gallon size!"
B00016R5IS,2012,3,4.0,8,8,346,"Great product but you have to know how to use it correctly","I am 31 years old with extremely acne prone skin and cystic acne. The oils in this product are 100% noncomedogenic and this product does not cause me to break out.  I tried this product because I want something natural to help with acne marks and fine lines. I jumped straight to the 10% based on these reviews. The first time I used this I was breaking out terribly and so upset. I woke up in the morning and all of my acne was flat (no longer inflamed) and the redness reduced. I thought it was a miracle. So I kept using it every night (which was too often!) and had bad results until I figured out how to balance my usage. If you use it too often without adjusting to it, your skin will almost get a thin, hard, dry, red layer on top and no surprise, this will cause you to break out (which is why the company recommends starting at the 5% level). If you take a day or two off the red/dryness goes away and you can start over (I never peeled, but did have dry flakey skin from overusage until I found my balance). I found that from the start I could do 2 nights on, 1 night off. Now I am up to using every night and that has been the perfect balance for me. I would recommend starting with every other night if you haven't used the 5% version first. This product dries up pimples and gives your skin a nice glow. It hasn't 100% stopped my acne, but I have had severe acne and it is MUCH improved. I would compare the ""miracle"" effect to the effect you get from a slight sunburn on acne, it flattens acne and makes your skin look great (people with acne you probably know what I mean), however unlike a sunburn this is not damaging to your skin. As long as I do not overdo the usage and use a good moisturizer, it is great for my skin. I definitely recommend it."

Now I use this cream at night, and it goes on thick but leaves a soothing feel to your face.  The tingling sensation has never really occurred for me, I guess I was lucky; however, I don't have that sensitive of skin.  Their isn't much of a smell to the cream, either, which is a plus.  Overall my skin feels better, new forming acne ""zapped"" and diminished within the next day, but I feel like it is too soon to judge the appearance of my acne scars.  I think I'll wait six months and see.  I think the use of other natural products has aided me in a successful routine and contributed to the good effects I'm seeing, possibly as a combination with this refreshing cream.  I'm using manuka honey masks three times a week, Kiss my Face Start Up Wash cleanser every morning followed by Kiss my Face Peaches n' Creme AHA 8% moisturizer, and a nightly cleanser (Shea Terra Organics Anti-Acne cleanser) (mixed with baking soda on nights that I use the Reviva cream, to neutralize the acidity) followed by either the kiss my face moisturizer, or this Reviva cream, which I only use three nights a week.  I also use a montmorillonite or all natural organic seaweed mask once a week.  My skin has been helped tremendously.

I used this on my chest a couple days in a row because i had some acne there and noticed some peeling on my skin after using, so i skipped a few days and just moisturized and it has gotten much better.

Since using the Reviva cream I have had only a couple of isolated pimples and usually have no breakouts at all.  My acne is completely gone and if I do get an occasional pimple, it is much less deep and noticeable.  I also notice a big difference in smoothness and overall complexion.  My skin looks so much better that my father started asking me what I was using on my skin since it looked so good.  I now have my parents using the cream and my mom has noticed a huge difference in the age spots on her hands and face.  My husband has also commented that my face looks amazing since starting the cream nightly.

And it is so gentle if you use it for only 2 minutes like the directions say. I use it every third or fourth night. It got rid of all the extra skin cells that were just chillin' on my face and helped the medicine get in and do its magic. Plus, it has all sorts of stuff in it to help & prevent acne. Now I have literally 2 pimples on my face. PLUS it is helping get rid of/lighten those red spots acne leaves behind.

I have to admit when I ordered this I did not realize it was geared toward anti aging because it sends lip and eye serum for wrinkles and at 21 its not necessary.  A bonus is that the red marks from previous acne almost gone, example had a almost lipstick red postmark on my forehead of all wonderful places, and usually one like that takes some time to fade (months), and this was like a very light pink the NEXT day.... and 4 days later after skin completely healed practically gone.

You're supposed to rub it *around* not rub it *in.*  Start gently and you'll get a feeling for how much you need to rub.  Then when you add the activator, be prepared for it to foam and get warm - I LOOOOVE that part!  I just wish it stayed warm.  I leave it on 5 minutes - the longest time recommended and then, before I  rinse it off, I do one last quick scrub to loosen up any dead skin that the activator may have worked on.		I do this peel every weekend and it's something I look forward to - and what's more fun is that people are commenting on how beautiful my skin looks - and when you're 50 years old, that's a really nice thing to hear."

I highly recommend this item to everyone, no matter what skin type and age."

Bought other Philosophy products that did not live up to the hype around this product. Was pleasantly surprised with the scent of Grace, but it doesn't last either. Hope in a Jar, When Hope is not enough, and neck creme did not do anything for me either."
B00068CG3U,2005,6,5.0,2,26,96,"sounds great","I'm 13 years old, and have heard all about how wonderful these philosophy products are. I'm just curious if I'm old enough to use it, or if it will damage my skin because I'm younger than most people using this. I am already used to washing my face every morning and every night (and trust me, I haven't forgotten to wash my face since february 19 2005.) Along with scrubing, steaming, and put a mask on once a week, I also get a facial once a month. Hope these products work for me, please reply soon!"
B00068CG3U,2011,9,4.0,2,2,70,"Well worth the price","Had to talk myself into the product because of the price,but after reading all of the reviews decided to give it a try. I will not think twice about reordering it. I did not see miraculous results instantly like many others, but after the second application my skin became baby soft, after the third noticed fine lines and wrinkles are minimizing. Mild pleasant scent adds to the ""Spa like facial""."
B00068CG3U,2008,0,5.0,2,2,368,"Excellent Product with RESULTS that you can see & feel","This is one product that I have definitely spent my money on and that I truly believe in. I too received a smaller sample version that, once it ran out, I had to replace.		I use this product once every couple of weeks. When I do, my skin looks completely refreshed, similar to when I get a professional facial at the spa. In fact, I felt a bigger difference using this product than I did after my last facial!		This renews my skin and the renewal feeling and look last much longer than a day. Another reviewer mentioned that you could use a facial scrub and get the same results, but I disagree. With a regular scrub, the result lasts only a day or so. With the peel, my skin looks great for days, even for a couple weeks. In addition, the last time I used it, I noticed a few days later that the skin on my hands felt great, and then I remembered that I had used the peel. So, no matter where on  your body you try it, you'll see results.		For me, it's not that I look spectacularly different. I just know that in the past, I'd have clogged pores and they were visible to the eye. Now I use Purity soap on my face daily, and this peel no less than once a month (and often more!)...... and I get compliments on my skin often. I don't have the BEST of complexions, but I get compliments! To me, that's the best part. And I only started getting compliments on my skin when I started using these products.		Many people tell me my skin glows.		I hate to spend this much money on something, but I have to say, I am a loyal customer of this product by Philosophy.		Oh, and my ONLY complaint? If I am spending that much on a product, I sure wish Philosophy would put the product in a MUCH nicer container. The activator bottle is as homely looking as a bottle of glue! At least with some of my other products that I splurge on (Bobbi Brown, Chanel) you get beautiful packaging along with the great (and expensive) product."

Most things take time to work however from the moment I used this peel I saw immediate results.  You want your skin to look clearer, radiant, more even toned instantly?  Not to mention the unbelievable soft feel.  Then this is the product to use.		I am also sensitive in certain areas so I don't use the peel in those areas like the folds of my nose.  However this has never made my skin irritaed or red.  I am very impressed by this product.  It promises to get rid of dull skin and that is exactly what it does!"
B00068CG3U,2006,10,5.0,2,2,118,"Takes off the years","This is the best micro peel I have ever tried!  The thing I noticed first was that when I applied ""when hope is not enough"" and ""the present""  they went on so smoothly.  They absorbed equally.  In my mid-30's, my young skin is fading, but this really brought it back.  I won't say I am 19 again, but I am sure the difference is obvious.  I am a hairstylist and my customers have been making mention of how great my skin looks since I added this to my bag of tricks.  It is a lot more effective that I would have thought, and I have not had a microdermabrasion since I started using this 2-4 times per month."

I decided to research a peel I could safely do at home, so I began looking through tons of product reviews. Philosophy's Microdelivery Peel (with vitamin c/peptide resurfacing crystals) had consistent rave reviews. I figured i could get multiple at home peels with it for the price of one in office peel. I LOVE IT! My skin looks and feels amazing every time I use it, which is about once a week. My 21 year old daughter's skin has also looked better than ever since I began using it on her skin as well. This is a 5 star product, and I am a hard to please customer! LOL. I definitely recommend it, as well as the fantastic Philosophy  ""Hope in a Jar"" cream I apply afterwards."

Just be careful to not apply any on your eyebrows and pull back your hair really tight coz it gets annoying when it sticks to your hair. Apply a thick amount, be generous or else you will end up with a very thin layer that is hard to peel. I don't mind it but I like trying new things. This peel off is not my permanent one yet. And oh, when you look at the peel microscopically, you can notice that it does pull off dead skin and cells. I like such results."

I have had the unfortunate circumstance of adult acne and after using it, my face is much less inflammed, the redness is gone and my face has a ""dewy-look"" all the next day.  I always use it the night before a big day or evening as it leaves my face radiant.  Regardless if it does not have the melon and ginseng, it is a fantastic product.  I recommend it for teens (that's when I started using it!) as well as adults."
B00005NFBJ,2010,10,5.0,12,13,81,"Thick Good Product","I purchased this product off amazon after watching American Psycho.  It's not the exact one but works amazingly.		Fairly sticky to the touch, you apply a generous amount all over your face.  If you don't put on enough it won't peel off as easily.  Do it quickly because it is fast drying.  The bottle recommends 5-10 mins but I suggest 10-15 mins.		It leaves your skin feeling clean, soft, and smooth.  You won't be upset.  I recommend using a moisturizer afterwards."

My mom used to use this when I was little and we would have fun peeling off together.  Great product. Fresh and light and love the softness of my skin afterwards.	I like to alternate Freeman's grape seed peel off one night, clay/avacado/oatmeal 2nd night, cucumber peel 3rd....rotation.  Always using a moisturizer and spf and occasion retinol eye cream by ROC.

I do recommend applying a thin layer, that way it wont be so hard to peel off but other that that, its pretty good. My face looked a lot cleaner and it was very refreshing.

B00005NFBJ,2011,3,3.0,7,8,135,"Clean and refreshing yes, but removes impurities? Depends on your definition","This is inexpensive and does peel easily and does leave the skin smooth. I'm sure it even clears some impurities, just don't expect results like Biore strips. This product does NOT remove blackheads, if that's what you're looking for. If you've ever used Biore strips, you know how effective they are and how gross they look after using. There's like a little forest of oil deposits sticking up from the strip. Very effective, but for limited areas, expensive and leave the face feeling overly dried out (probably because of all the oil they remove). The Freeman Facial Peel does not even come close to that level of cleansing. If you want a moderate cleansing and smoother skin, this product is fine. If you want a more thorough cleansing with visible removal of blackheads, look elsewhere."

It's pretty cheap in price (I bought it at Wal*Mart) and it definitely leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed. You have to apply just the right amount or else it may be layered on too thick or too thin, making it slightly harder to peel off either way. But it's kind of common sense what's the ""right"" amount to apply, you know, so this isn't really an issue! It also lasts quite a while. I've had mine since about September. I use it in the very least weekly, if not a couple times a week (depending on my schedule and skin's health, etc.) and I still have about half of the bottle left. I definitely recommend this and will be buying again. :)"

This product has done that and so much more. When I first started using this mask, I had 4 huge pimples and inflamed skin due to a bad reaction to the aforementioned X-Out. After the first use, this mask got rid of the inflammation and within the next two days all my pimples had dried out!	I've just been using regular bar soap and this product until I can figure out a new cleanser to try, and my skin is once again clear and soft. This is a fantastic product, and a total aside from its effectiveness: it's a lot of fun to use, it just peels right off after it dries. Way fun!

You know when you get glue on your hands and peel it off as a kid? Same thing, except you can't spread it around like Elmer's. It took me forever to get it off my face and was not nice because I have peach fuzz. It got in my hair and I had to wash it out, and I didn't see a difference whatsoever in my face except that it was red from trying to get it all off.

It breaks a bit when you peel unless you are very slow about it. When applying to your face you might want to make sure you have water on the side to start washing your hands off, its very sticky and needs a bit of soap to get off!

It will dry fast so smooth it over your face fast and wait about 20 minutes and peel it off and then wash your face. 5-10 minutes is not long enough in my opinion and make sure to not put it on your eyebrows or sideburns because when your peeling it off it will be very hard to get it off your hair.

It has a chemical odor and it essentially involves applying a  clear glue-like gel to the face.  I wash my face, blot dry and then apply a thick layer of this stuff to my face.  It washes off my hands easily.  Then the fun begins!  Let the clear gel dry for 10-15 minutes then pull this off your face in one piece if possible.  It feels like pulling dried glue from the face but it mostly comes on one rubbery, stretchy sheer sheet.  This doesn't seem to irritate my skin,but if feels like every pore gets unplugged when the product is peeled off.  I use this every two or three days.  WARNING! DO NOT GET THIS INTO YOUR HAIRLINE!

So I ordered it and when it finally came, I just had to use it that night. And let me tell you! I've been using this mask twice a week for a few months now, and my face looks and feels great. It also helped to reduce some of the puffiness under my eyes. They're invisible now! It makes me feel like I've been to a spa. The only reason I gave it one less of a star is because when the mask is left on overtime, it's hard to peel off. But if you leave it on for the right amount of time, it peels off easily. Other than that, I'm really happy with this product."
B00005NFBJ,2011,8,5.0,2,2,50,"Excellent product!","I love peel-off masks.. my 2 daughters and I use these as part of a weekly ritual where we just hang out, put on peel-off masks & paint our nails!

I've been using it for a few months now and have not had one complaint. I actually stumbled upon this product by chance at a local CVS. My husband and I were looking for new facial cleansers because nothing in the past has worked for either of us. So after going up and down the aisles I came across this product and decided to give it a shot. I have to say since day 1 after peeling off the mask my skin feels so refreshed. It's literally feels like a weighted layer has been lifted. I use this product at night and the next day my skin feels so smooth and clean. No excess oil when I wake up and my skin doesn't flake as it normally does on my forehead especially. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone."
B00005NFBJ,2010,11,5.0,2,2,68,"Great face product!","I should have bought 2 at a time as one tube may last about 1 month if used 2-3 a week. Exactly what I was looking for. Thick gel applied all over face and after 10 minutes, slowly peel off and pull away dead skin and hopefully grabs some junk out of pores. Seems to dry out my face though, so don't use everynight, and use a moisturizer."

I bought this and a mint julep clay-based masque to help with expanding pores and blackheads... after watching American Psycho again.  Basically, this product is amazing.  It's fun to use, easy to clean up, and it WORKS.  My female friends commented on how smooth and clear my skin was after I used it a few times.  Cute girls wanting to touch my face = a win in my book.  You seriously can't go wrong with this and I like it significantly more than the mint julep masque."
B00005NFBJ,2013,0,3.0,1,1,88,"There are pros and there are cons","One thing I liked about this mask was that after it had dried and it was time for me to peel it off it didn't feel like ripping a bunch of band-aids off my face.		I didn't really notice a difference with the way it treated my skin, though. My skin didn't get softer or anything. Keep in mind though that I used just this product and nothing else until it was empty.		So maybe if you use this with something else it might work a little harder."

The only issues I have are that the mask is clear so it's hard to see where you've put it on your face and also that if you don't put it on thick enough, it's hard to peel off.

I love the smell of flowers and perfumes and such, but i also love the smell of chemicals so i don't know if it smells bad to the general public or not but it smells alright to me.		I have combination/acne prone skin and if i don't exfoliate i get dry flakes and my skin gets this gross buildup of dead cells. This stuff never bothered my skin-it actually feels cool and refreshing to me-which is saying a lot because many face masks make my skin burn like i just slapped Icyhot on it.		As a kid i would spend hours putting glue on my hands and wrists and then peeling it off once it dries. This reminds me of that a lot except it doesn't make your hands feel all boogery after application.		Anyways it makes my skin soft and pulls  a lot of dead skin off that i would have had to abrasively scrub off otherwise. No complaints here. This face peel is the kitty's titties.		Just don't get it in your eyebrows. That sucks. You have to wash it out with warm water to get it to dissolve. And i'm not sure if i'm not putting enough on or what but i usually end up washing my face afterwards to completely remove any scraggly leftovers."

LOVE IT!","I've had this for 15 years and now there's a new design that enables you to transport/change the rubber bands much easier whereas mine stretches the bands too much because they need to go over the wide ends so it wears them out faster for that week.	Years ago, I never really needed to worry much about sagging as I'd been fortunate to have young looks for most of my life, but now that I'm over 60 I'm seeing the turning point! ha ha So, after trying other methods that failed me, I saw this in my closet and decided to revisit it and I must say, with exciting results!  Within just a couple of weeks I was definitely seeing some improvement and my brother thought it was because I'd been on the Paleo diet, which I've pretty much eaten for at least a year now, so I knew that wasn't it.  But didn't want to fess up yet.  Since I have the earlier model, I don't have their cream, never did.  So I've been using Spectrum's Coconut Oil that makes your skin youthful again.  My jowls are starting to dissipate after about a month and the sides of my face have lifted considerably.  Even my best friend noticed after just two weeks use and I hadn't told her anything! I'm getting her one for Christmas. Once I hit the 12 week mark, they say you should see the resounding difference, and when people ask me, I'll probably want to tell the world because once I know about something that works well, I like sharing the good so others can too. Make sure you follow the DVD instructions and you'll be exceedingly happy with your results.  I didn't have the DVD years ago and I feel that if I had, I would have stuck with it for sure.  Wishing you the best results ever! :)		ADDITIONAL NOTE: I wasn't seeing results as quickly as anticipated on my neckline.  So recently, I started ""kneading"" just under my chin line (using my pointer fingers up to my first knuckle) from just under my chin working out to underneath my earlobes at the same time exercising my face to 120 reps.  (The Neckline Slimmer for 2 min. 2x-3x daily helps as well.)  Also, I doubled up on my rubber bands w/in 2 weeks, using 2 - 6oz. bands instead of the initial recommended 6oz. for 3 months as I was looking for more immediate results and got it.  Everyone's different, so it's your call.  I fully expect to be doing my ""happy dance"" by Christmas - hope you do too!  Yo!"

I have been using this little facial flex device twice daily for about a month and a half and OMG I can totally see a DIFFERENCE!  I am almost 33 and I was beginning to notice facial sagging in my cheeks (the very beginning of jowls).  I bought the Carol Maggio exercise DVD (which is great, but totally time consuming) and was looking for something else that took less time to do each day!  I stumbled upon this product, read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I am totally noticing tone in my face...especially around the mouth and jaw line. It's amazing.  Honestly, everyone should get this mouth piece.  I do 200 exercises a day morning and night... right after I brush my teeth.  It's convenient and it works.  Get it."

Still, we all age and like many, I'm a bit vain and am willing to fight for my right to be as gorgeous as I can at any age.		I got my Facial Flex on December 8th (today is the 17th) and have used it twice a day since.  First, I used the 6 oz. bands but after two days it seemed to weak for me.  Still, I noticed during the day when I turned my head left or right that my neck and chest felt a little tight.  Not in a bad way. It just let me know it's working.		By the third day, I switched to the 8 oz. bands.  I was able to do about 120 reps and today I am using one 6 oz. band and one 8 oz. band.  I was going to buy the 14 oz. bands but figured I'd use up what I have first.		The resistance with the two bands is now perfect.  I know because when I'm doing my exercises, I can almost NOT compress the device all the way.  It feels good when I take it out.  I really feel it.  And my face and neck are already showing definition.		And just so I wouldn't be tricked by my eyes, I took a picture of myself on the 8th before using it and today, remarkably my jawline is more defined, my neck looks *stronger* somehow, my chin is more squared and I'm just plain pleased.  Yes, I can see myself using this product well into the future.  I can't wait to see what 6 weeks brings.		Another great benefit it my lips.  They're plumper, juicier and lipstick glides on with fewer lines showing now.  As a note to anyone who's using it, take this tip: besides moisturizing beforehand, be sure to moisturize your lips, too.  I put on good ole Chap Stick in the black tube before using it to keep them supple while ""working out"".		At work yesterday someone asked if I was getting more rest during this holiday season.  My face looks bright and has a glow.  A good facial scrub and a masque once a week and I've got my regimen down.  How easy is that?		If you're thinking about making the purchase but you just aren't sure, take it from me.  You don't have to be 50 or 60 to see dramatic results in a short amount of time.		I'm very tempted to use it more frequently but I'm sticking to my twice a day for 2 minutes.  I set the timer on my microwave and go at it.		I am SO looking forward to my 44th birthday next month.  If I get results like these in just days, another full month should be incredible.  I'm taking a new picture every week just for my own proof.		Amazing product!	------------	One more note --		I noticed after posting this that the product I have is the Facial Flex Ultra but I doubt the product is so significantly different as to make a difference in results."

Before using facial flex, I was so concerned about my nasal labial folds which were becoming noticable.

However, I have a pretty bad TMJ injury from a car wreck that no longer really bothers me. But after using this, my TMJs hurt for four days later, which triggered a bad headache. So do not buy if you have any kind of TMJ problem as it really works those joints, which I am not so sure is anatomically good for anyone if it hurt me this much. At least it does not seem to cause the joints to pop or grind."

Anyways, it's a simple product to use, but I felt that the 6oz and 8oz bands weren't doing enough for me (it felt too easy and I couldn't feel adequate tension, maybe it is because I'm younger and my face muscles are firmer, I don't know...) so I got some 14oz bands off of eBay for supercheap and have been using them since!

I think this product will be more effective at slowing down the clock rather than reversing aging. This is not to say theres a problem with the product -- I just dont put much faith in anything that promises to turn the clock back.

I don't recommend the cream AT ALL you can't use it. Facial-Flax better make a quality cream rather then a cheap cream it ruin the product it self. It's possible Facial-Flex sent me a very old stock of cream I don't know."
B0000YV83O,2012,10,4.0,1,1,417,"Interesting.  :)","My boyfriend purchased this for my birthday (my idea, thank goodness).  I say it's interesting because of how utterly ridiculous it looks when you're using it.  You have to make sure that your upper teeth are completely covered by your upper lip and that your mouth remains in an oval shape.  The device is cradled between the corners of your mouth, and you squeeze the device inward.  You might drool.  Needless to say, I'll be doing my facial workouts in private.  ;)		Like many users, at first I was skeptical, especially for the price.  The cost seems a bit high, and I felt guilty that he paid so much.  I wanted this particular kit for the instructional DVD, which wasn't necessary.  There are a variety of videos on a popular tube site if one is interested in looking them up under ""Facial Flex Ultra"".  It's a simple gadget and comes with an instructional booklet.  I've only had it for a few days so I can't speak for it's efficacy, but I can definitely feel those muscles working, particularly in my cheeks and jawline.  I have no doubt that I will see results.  My main objective with this device is to tone my neck muscles.  The instructions say to lean slightly forward and keep your chin level to benefit this area, but I was feeling very little flexing there.  I felt much, much more neck muscle action when I tilted my head completely back (and less salivation).  I do as many repetitions as I can in 2 sets.		I read the reviews before I added this item to my wish list, and I noted one from someone who complained that the cream was spoiled.  I can confirm this by saying that the cream smells very spoiled and I won't be using it (hence 4 stars).  The cream has a dense, waxy texture and has a light brown, bubbly appearance (according to images from the DVD, it should simply look pinkish in color and creamy).  This item was sold by Pro Therapy Supplies and fulfilled by Amazon.  It comes with a small supply of both 6 oz and 8 oz resistance bands (20 each) which need to be replaced weekly per instructions.  I found that I needed to double up on the 8 oz bands.  Replacement bands can be found both on Amazon and eBay.

I drive long distances & use in the car for last two weeks & already see great improvements (about 50%).  I expect contined improvement in the next couple of months.  Keep the bands tight. I moved up to a the next level after first couple of days & glad I did. Better for me working those muscles. Highly recommend. I'm in my early 60's .

Shortly thereafter I was putting on my base makeup and I could feel a difference. There was a definite firm muscle surface and my skin felt much firmer. I've never stopped using it.  It takes  a minute a day to keep my face firm.  I don't have jowls and there is no flabby skin. People assume I'm a decade or two younger than I am. If you want to stay looking your best with a firm face (and no plastic surgery) this is the way to do it!"

After using it for a couple of days the inside of both cheeks had abrasions and hurt.  I thought perhaps I was using it wrong so I reread the pamphlet and watched the video again, but I was using it correctly.  Maybe it's my anatomy, I know I have a small mouth.  I'm disappointed that I can't use this because it causes abrasions. I do think it's a good concept.  Do they really need to make the ends of the part that goes in the mouth so big?  Did anyone have a similar experience with this? Really disappointed."

However, this year (when I really needed it) I bought it from Amazon, and the piece broke within 1 week. They appeared to have changed manufacturing and now make it much cheaper. Will order again shortly but its gone up about 20.00 per unit and I cant believe it broke so easily.

I try to limit my innate vanity, I will never have cosmetic surgery and I won't buy expensive creams (what marketing guru said, ""make a woman insecure and you can sell her anything""?) but an excercise-based ""beauty program"" seemed worth trying-I lift weights to keep off upper-arm flaps, why not do the same to keep off jowls?  At almost 40 I was seeing sagging around my jaw and my chin was receding.  After using Facial-Flex just as instructed (except I usually don't use their cream) for a week my jaw was cleaning up, my profile was coming back and my skin felt firmer and looked more even!  I'm not trying to look younger as such but I feel like myself again, I guess since this is the face I saw in the mirror when I was first building my identity.  This product can do what no cream can,and is worth way more than its price."

That being said, facial flex does work. I had a smile line that I couldn't get rid of and that was the only reason i paid $50 for something like that. Within two day, I am not kidding, the line was gone. No only that, my upper lip got fuller. It does make your face,neck and even tongue very sore at first, but just like with any other workout,you get used to it.	 I am very happy with the results and will continue using it.		UPD. I realized I forgot to mention that I am 26 y.o. with no skin aging issues just yet. I sleep on my right side, so overtime I got a crease along the smile line. I am still using the product, along with putting a ban-aid on the sides of my mouth when i go to sleep, so I don't get that line back. I also put petroleum jelly on the area(believe it or not it fills wrinkles in temporarily). If I forget to do my routine, the line comes back obviously, so it has to be done every day.	 I noticed that some people ordered the product based solely on my review and were disappointed with it, so I thought I'd edit it and let them know what kind of issue it fixed for me."

So I got this, and it is REALLY a miracle for me. My top lip plumps from it, and its getting easier to smile fully again.  I feel like my whole lower face is more toned.

I'm one of those people who often says I have 'tried everything' because, well, it feels like I have. From Accutane and other prescription products to drugstore finds to high end creams, I haven't left many stones unturned. All in my quest to curb an oily complexion that leads to acne.		I first discovered the Alpha Hydrox brand by accident at my local Walgreen's store while searching for new products. I purchased the Foaming Face Wash and the Enhanced Lotion, the two products carried in my local store. I quickly realized the lotion was too moisturizing for my oily skin, and purchased the Oil Free Formula instead. Believe it or not, it dried my skin WAY too much. So, I landed on the Souffle and haven't look back since. For my skin type, it really is just right!		I wash with the Foaming Face Wash twice daily and use the souffle afterwards each time. I typically follow up with a moisturizer of some kind, as my skin often feels a bit tight after using the Souffle. Alpha Hydrox's regular moiturizer in the tub is perfect.		I have noticed a major shift in my complexion after using the Souffle for the past 6 months or so. My acne has decreased significantly (I still get breakouts that time of the month, but that's an unrelated hormonal issue) and the overall texture and tone of my skin is drastically better. So much so, that I am not embarrassed to leaave the house without makeup on for the first time in my life! I've never had good skin, but this product has made me feel (and look) like I do.		I am 29 years old and often mistaken for a teenager--last week someone told me they thought I was 18 years old--and I believe my skin is a big part of that. And I now know it's not because of my acne, either!		This product is wonderful; take it from someone who has tried everything else!"
B000G8LWZI,2012,11,5.0,1,1,139,"Who Ever Is Listening..........","I am 58. I have been accused of being my son's girlfriend -- solely on the basis of my skin. I have been using La Prairie Cellular Radiance for the last nine years. I am a registered nurse -- it was another RN who introduced me to La Prairie via a fabulous Nordstrom facial special. Many times, I have tried different, cheaper, well-known and less effective moisturizers; all with the result of minor to major breakouts. Then I saw a review of AHA Souffle on MakeUpAlley.com and sent for the cheapest jar. I started to use it after my shower and before my La Prairie Cellular Radiance Cream. What a miraculous cream. NEVER has my skin looked this fabulous. No wrinkles, my age spots are fading (they used to be cute little freckles), and acne scars are fading fast."
B000G8LWZI,2012,10,5.0,1,1,275,"Terrific! - Beware of packaging","I am in my late 30s with fair skin and adult onset acne. I have started using the souffle about three months ago and have seen great results in not only significant reduction of break outs, but also in the way old scars and spots fade and become less visible. I should say that this product does take a couple of weeks to get used to as it did leave my skin stinging just slightly after application at first and I did see some redness. However, as the instruction leaflet says these do go away. Some people may find it helpful to use every other day at first, which is what I did. I now use the face wash from this line and the lotion which I use on my body every now and then, not daily. I do see that my skin looks brighter and more radiant. I am very happy with having finally found a product that works. Just do not forget to use a sunscreen!		UPD: The product no longer comes packaged as described. I attempted to receive what's pictured twice, and had to return it twice. The souffle used to come in a JAR, but only comes in a TUBE now. For those who don't like creams in a tube (I don't because a lot more of it is wasted as it is impossible to squeeze out exact amounts and pointless to get whatever little is left when the tube is almost empty) this is a point to consider. Amazon needs t change product description and picture. Switching to 10% cream from this line as it is available in a jar."

I kept having bumps that becomes blackhead then pimples and it leaves horrible scars. finally i tried clinique that got it under control.. but still did get breakouts once in a while. I bought this to clear my scars but it actually stopped me from breaking out! Im 3 weeks pimples free ( never happened before!!! ) The scars are taking much longer but my face it soft , smooth and glowing. I only used in PM's , now i am slowly using it in AM with Clinique SPF 25 over it.. Its my miracle."

For the past few months I've been using proactiv and found that made a huge positive difference, but it was only after I added this cream to my daily routine that a friend saw me and said my skin was glowing - she couldn't believe I wasn't wearing any extra make up.  I'm only 24, so I can't say how this works on older skin, but I hope to keep mine in good shape for many years, and this seems like a good product for it.		It tingles and sometimes stings a little when you put it on, but it really does make your skin glow.  I wear it daily under my make up and so far so good.

In the last few years I am finding it very difficult to find in stores. The last time I found it was in April 2008 and I purchased 2 jars that lasted me just about a year.  I have been searching for the last 2 months and have not been able to locate it so I just ordered it online.  Thank goodness for the online site!

Now I just wish I had gone ahead and spent the extra money on one of the peels I was initially going to go with & I will now. This Alpha cream is nothing but a moisturiser, for me at least. I saw NO difference, changes, smoothness, firmness, Nothing by using this cream.  It works for some, I guess but did nothing for me. I guess all I can say is try at your own risk, you may safe money now but will spend more later......its up to you. Live & learn."

B000G8LWZI,2012,2,3.0,1,2,105,"No result","I've been using this for almost 3 months but I haven't seen any change to my skin, except that the cheek areas on the sides of my nose are not as rough as they used to be. Other than that, my pores are still as enlarged as before, my age spots (and believe me, they are very small, and only three of them) are not improved and the texture of my skin is unchanged.		I like the consistency, though. It's very light and not greasy so I prefer it over Oil of Olay.	I probably won't buy again if I find a better exfoliating product."
B000G8LWZI,2010,11,5.0,1,2,190,"Definite improvement","I had stopped using Alpha Hydrox for a while - I kept meaning to order more, but I had other creams to use, and I didn't notice a difference - at first...When I notices the fine lines coming back, I realized I needed to reorder NOW!  I tried the 10% solution first and did see an improvement in my skin, but not as much as I'd seen with the 12% product I had been using.  So back to the 12%.  There is a definite difference versus the other affordable skin care products.  My skin is smoother, and doesn't break out as much (after the first 2 or so weeks when the breakouts were more noticable).  Skin discoloration is less, and my makeup goes on more smoothly.  And best of all, people are surprised when I tell them how old I am (they usually were guessing 5 to 10 years less).		One caveat - in the winter my skin does get drier with the 12% (less with the 10%) and I do need to use a moisturizer on top of the Alpha Hydrox. In the summer I don't need the moisturizer."
B000G8LWZI,2010,11,5.0,1,2,367,"consistent results, great maintainence cream.","YES.  I am 26, with dry, sensitive skin.  Taking birth control for more than 5 years has left me with hyper-pigmentation and uneven skin tone.  I purchased this cream after recently quitting smoking as part of my ""taking care of myself"" routine... and I couldn't be happier.  I use this stuff AM & PM, and have found it to be extraordinarily well-tolerated.  I used to exfoliate my face with St. Ives (I know.) every morning.  If I didn't, I would end up with nasty flakes, no matter how much moisturizer I used.  My skin would feel like an oil slick, but still dry underneath, and this would lead to breakouts.  I have been using this cream as an exfoliant in conjunction with filtered jojoba oil, and the results have been just really delightful.  Even, bright skin tone (noticeable results after a week, although skin feels better after the first use), minimized pores, and an all-over glow that is SO EXCITING!  Don't be afraid of the tingle/itchiness for the first few days; it subsided after a half hour or so and did NOT lead to breakouts.		I bought mine at Ulta for around $15.00.		I really recommend this cream, and am planning on purchasing another jar.		EDIT (still using 3 months later):		I wish this came in a pump container.  ONLY complaint.		This is a fantastic, affordable alpha hydroxy cream.  It has a reasonable percentage of glycolic acid to use as a nightly exfoliating product.  It's gentle, doesn't break me out, and provides consistent improvement.		If you want something heavier, I would recommend Skin Laboratory's 35% glycolic peel.  This Alpha Hydrox cream will NOT give you the dramatic results a peel with a higher percentage will.  It WILL, however, maintain the results from said peels and will refine your skin.  I really recommend this cream as an alternative to manual exfoliation.  It also works as a spot treatment.		Lastly, make sure you use sunblock religiously, as with any alpha hydroxy.  This is really important.  Not only will your hard work be canceled out, you will see OPPOSITE results (i.e. dark spots will become darker, etc.).  This is why I recommend using this cream at night.		A++ HG material."
B000G8LWZI,2010,10,5.0,1,2,51,"Everything is true!","Everything that other good reviews say about this product is true. I am a physician and have used the same compound  (glycolic acid)for years now. I find there is nothing better for wrinkles or black spots. This particular presentation is very easy to use and very effective. I absolutely recommend it."
B000G8LWZI,2010,3,5.0,1,1,98,"Works for me","I have used this product on and off for years.  It works for me.  My face is smoother and skin softer and the over all look much more bright.  I get seduced (ha ha who doesn't) by cosmetic claims and I try the products but I seem to always come back to this one as my stand by. The other products are more expensive and actually don't work as well for me.  I am going to stick with this one from now on. The price is right and it does what it says.  What more can you ask."
B000G8LWZI,2010,0,5.0,1,1,76,"Wonderful Product!","Have been using this product for about 5-6 years and absolutely love it! I previously used the 10% cream for a lot of years prior, which was fine, but like the souffle much better. It even zaps my occasional middle age zits. Make sure you use sunscreen with this product if used during the day. It has really improved the look of my normal-oily skin. I use it morning and evening and wouldn't be without it!"

B000G8LWZI,2009,10,3.0,1,1,96,"A little too harsh for my skin...","I really like the texture of this product. It's not greasy and it sinks in quickly. I like that it has no added dyes or fragrances. It's also a great price for what you get. However, it's too harsh for my face. I used it for two weeks before giving up. It left my skin very red and irritated. It felt like it was burning. It works well on my feet and elbows, but the skin on my face is just too sensitive. I think I need a product with a lower amount of glycolic acid."
B000G8LWZI,2008,11,5.0,1,1,133,"Acne or wrinkles, give it a try!","I used this way back in the day when AHAs were the new big thing. I didn't pick it back up until about 6 weeks ago, and boy I could kick myself for not giving this stuff a fighting chance years ago. It really helped with acne, as well as reversing the beginnings of fine crow's feet on my right eye, made spots fade... it's hard to believe this is my skin. One jar looks like about a 3 month supply, so one purchase will be enough for you to decide if it's for you or not. If you're acne prone and wary of putting a cream on your face, this is not greasy, but your skin will not really be dry, either. This is definitely worth a try for just about everyone."
B000G8LWZI,2008,7,5.0,1,1,78,"love it","I use this every night with a retin a cream every other night, reduced my breakouts and improved the wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead. I have extremely sensitive skin (redhead, freckles, 35 with dry skin prone to breakouts), this worked perfectly. My skin is clearer, fresh looking and brighter. I would highly recommend adding this to your daily skin care routine. I also use a vitamin c cream in the mornings. The combination is great."
B000G8LWZI,2011,7,5.0,3,4,478,"Amazing Product!","I am absolutely thrilled with the results that I have gotten with this product in the short time that I have been using it. I am skeptical about most products that promise results in which acne or fine lines will improve dramatically with use but this is the only one that has delivered on those promises for me.		I am 36 years old and I have fair, sensitive, oily, extremely acne prone skin and it has been a problem for me for over 20 years. I have tried everything to keep my acne under control. Everything! But nothing has ever worked for long. My biggest problem is pores that clog like crazy and nothing I tried could keep them clear, so I would be broken out constantly or just ready to break out. It doesn't help that I am skin obsessed either ( touching and picking is a no-no, but I couldn't help it) so my skin always looked raw and sore. I also have scarring and and using makeup to help cover the damage only made me break out more, so I felt helpless everyday and depressed.		After going to a dermatologist, he said that I was going about this the wrong way entirely. I had been using benzoyl peroxide products and he said that for older skin this can aggravate the problem even more. Instead, he gave me a glycolic acid/ salicylic acid face wash and told me to try this product in addition to see if it helped at all to keep my pores unclogged and it really does! I used to have many blackheads and clogged pores and now they are drastically reduced. I look at my skin and see very few to none now and for me that is a miracle. I am losing the desire to constantly touch my face as well. This product makes your skin baby soft and helps to erase fine lines too. I also use it on my chest, where I also used to break out constantly, and that has helped enormously as well.		The price, benefits and promises that this product deliver are all reasons to buy this product. But you will keep using it after discovering how amazing it can be for your skin to be mostly clear almost all of the time if you have suffered with acne as I have. I am so so happy with the results I got.		When first using it your skin will tingle and feel burning, but that goes away. I only use it at night and I also mix the product with moisturizer to hydrate my skin at the same time. Also, you might break out a little until you have used the product for a few days as I did, but then I cleared up and have stayed clear. This truly is a miracle in a jar!"
B000G8LWZI,2010,4,2.0,3,4,55,Ouch!,"I got a horrible reaction to this cream. My face got terribly scarred and I am still recovering from it.

B000G8LWZI,2010,10,1.0,4,6,180,"Breakouts are worst I've ever had","I really wanted to love this after reading all the great reviews.  I've been using it for about five months now.  The breakouts are UNBEARABLE.  I get pimples!! under my chin, on my neck, under my nose, on my nose, on my forehead.....I break out terribly.  I thought, after reading the reviews, that this would pass and the benefits would far outweigh the breakouts but this product has made me break out worse than anything else I've ever tried.  I went so far as to purchase their foaming face wash and moisturizer to see if using products from the same line would lessen the breakouts.  I hate my complexion right now.  I don't see any benefit.  Sorry.  What was this product supposed to do again?  I have to reiterate....terrible terrible pimples.  Gross.  I haven't broken out this badly since I was a teenager.  I'm embarrassed.  Still have an unopened jar so the good thing is that I didn't spend $50 for a jar so it won't bother me so much to give it away to someone that might like it!"
B000G8LWZI,2013,1,5.0,0,0,102,"A GREAT moisturizer!","I read the reviews about this product and decided to go ahead and buy it. I have been using it for a week, only at night and my skin just glows. I have had no adverse reaction like others though I have problem skin, I still break out, so I think this will help my skin a lot. Its not greasy, very light and one needs very little. The tube is easy to carry for traveling. I normally do not write reviews so soon but I can already tell the difference it has made to my skin and I am very happy."
B000G8LWZI,2007,8,5.0,99,102,460,AMAZING,"I have never taken the time to actually review a product but I just had to for this one.  Let me tell you a little bit about my skin condition and how this product has affected me.		I'm 26 years old with very fair skin.  However, many of my high school/college years were spent in a tanning bed.  I've always loved my skin when tan but when it finally sunk in that if I kept tanning I would look like a prune, I luckily stopped for good.  However, I always hated the way my skin looked.  Very blotchy, often dry, and I still get pimples at 26! I've tried every product under the sun and nothing, at least for me has lived up to its promises!		This product is truly amazing.  When I first tried it, it stung my sensitive skin.  I used it for about 2 weeks then stopped because I didn't think it was working.  If you have acne prone skin, it will make you break out a little at first because all of those pimples will be forced to the surface.  So I stopped using it.  However, after reading all the good reviews, I decided to give it another shot.  It's been about a month of using this product and boy have I seen drastic changes in my skin.  My skin is 100 percent softer and smoother.  Old acne scars that I had (my skin scars very easily) are lightening up and my complexion is much more even.  And, the best part is, I get no more pimples so don't have to use drying products like benzoyl peroxide anymore!!  My face is so smoothe throughout the day and it stays that way!  It is truly amazing, but the trick is, you HAVE to give it about a month before you will truly see results! Be patient!!		Ok, for those with a similar skin condition to me, just want to let you know my skin care routine using this product.		Morning - wash with cetaphil daily cleanser, apply alpha hydroxy souffle, let dry then apply good moisturizer ( i use eucerine spf30) Make sure you use a noncomedogenic one with a good sunscreen!!		Evening - wash with plexion cleansing clothes (need prescription), apply alpha hydroxy souffle, then a good night cream ( i use neutrogena visibly even night cream and it's worked wonders)		I also take nicomide which is a vitamin my dermatologist prescribed for helping with acne.		Sorry this review is so long, but I just really wanted to offer my advice and let you know what has given me amazing results!  If it wasn't for websites like this, I would never have known to purchase all of the products I use! I really hope this helps!!"
B000G8LWZI,2007,9,5.0,55,56,89,"Best I have found.","I am 60 years old and have tried every high-end product on the market. After one week of using the Souffle my skin glowed, felt extrememly soft, and was noticed by my husband (who doesn't notice anything!) Some other products left my skin greasy or dry and flaking. I have rosacea and it has become less noticable. This is just right and I can't say enough good about it. Nothing is going to change my skin back to my 20's but this does a great job of aging gracefully."
B000G8LWZI,2007,8,5.0,60,63,235,"Miracle in a jar","I am 24 years old and was searching for a cream that I can stick with for many years to come. This is the absolute only cream that has ever given me visible results in a short period of time. My skin RARELY breaks out anymore and my skin tone is sooooo even now. This also works wonders on old acne scars. This particular product may tend to dry out your skin so as reccomended on the jar I usually follow it up with a moisturizer. I just use the alpha hydrox spf 15 moisturizer. Another bit of advice if you are looking to try these products ....the alpha hydrox website is so much cheaper. I got a whole set that included the souffle, spf 15 lotion, facial peel, spot lightener, and face wash for around $40 including shipping. Their site also offers a whole sample set of all of the products listed above for $1 a piece. I bought 7 samples to test out before I bought the full size products. Also, you will learn from the website that its normal to break out when you first start using it because your skin is getting used to the aha's. I broke out a tiny bit and then it went away and now its working wonders. Now, if Alpha Hydrox would just invent a cream that cures chronic dark undereye cirlces I would be flawless."
B000G8LWZI,2008,5,5.0,18,18,401,"The BEST for preventive maintenance &repair of your skin","Quickly approaching (a still, sadly, rather vain) age 40, I have personally spent a small fortune over the years trying to slow the aging process and reverse the effects of too many days spent gardening without sunscreen.  I cannot even begin to list all the products I've somewhat foolishly gambled on to get my skin looking better.  This product--and several other products offered through the company NEOTERIC (all under the Alpha Hydrox brand)--are exactly the answer I've been looking for.  I've used them both alone and in conjunction with a more expensive brand of anti-aging products (for which I've also left good reviews on this site), and I can see great improvements both ways.		I decided to try this brand of alpha hydroxy cream after reading in Dr. Oz's (and Dr. Roizen's) book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743292561"">You: Staying Young: The Owner's Manual for Extending Your Warranty (You)</a>.  I'd tried several other alpha hydroxy products before this one (i.e. ROC, etc.) and must say this particular line (ALPHA HYDROX) is far superior to any other I've used.  That it is also apparently considerably less expensive than most is icing on the cake, in my book.		Regarding this product, I find the key is to use it AT LEAST once a day, and always after using a mild cleanser.  At my age I still get acne and, despite my sometimes manic picking, I notice it (and any residual puffiness or redness, and resulting scarring) clears up much, much more quickly than it used to.  Also, my skin breaks out much less than before I used this.  The tone and color of my skin are far improved when compared to prior to using this product.  I've run out of it before and tried to use something else until I was able to locate more locally, and to my dismay the condition of my skin began to deteriorate.		I won't try to insult anyone by saying the Alpha Hydrox line will remove every wrinkle or fix all your skincare woes.  If there is a product out there that does this, I want to know!  But for now, this is by far the best line of products I've used.  I use this item, particularly, with the line of skincare I reviewed previously, as that seems to address reversing the signs of aging better (where this one, for me, just improves the overall condition and appearance of my skin)."
B000G8LWZI,2009,9,5.0,15,15,484,"BEST product around for your money!!","This  is one of the best products I've ever used for over-all appearance of your skin, especially at this price!!  It is NOT a miracle deep wrinkle cream.  I've used many brands-- Clinique, Lancome, etc.!  I've sold cosmetics for two popular direct-market cosmetic companies. Battled with condome-type acne (white heads that flare up into pimples# all my life.  My dermatologist suggested an AHA #alpha hydroxy acid# years ago before it hit the markets.  It worked miracles for me as the retin A products were just too harsh. Not sure why the previous reviewers doctor gave such a harsh response.  Maybe because AHA's do work by breaking down the dead skin cells faster.  It's like comparing battery acid to lemon juice #citric acid# though.		If you haven't been using a quality skin care regimen, it can cause some extra condomes #white heads# or flare-ups the first few weeks.  I would worn my clients of this.  This will happen ANYTIME you begin a good skin care regimen, also.  There is a bunch of garbage there that has never been removed and now your cleaning house!  On average, you can probably expect 3-4 pimples by the second week, with one or two the next 2-3 weeks.  The good is that because your using this product, they will disappear quicker and they were flare-ups you were proably going to get at some point in the future- and now they're out of the way! For the worst skin, I would suggest starting at least 6-8 weeks before any major event: weddings, reunions, proms, etc.  Make sure you are using the right product for your skin type.  Oil-free for oily, acne prone skin; nourishing for dryer skin types.  Use with care if you have sensitive skin!  Try diluting it with a little water in the palm of your hand; do not scrub your face prior; try skipping a day or two in between.  If it is still irritating, skip the skin treatment products and try the facial cleansers instead-- your aiming at lowering the % of AHA that your skin is exposed to. I have used it on my preteens in this manner.		You do have to remember that AHA products aren't cosmetics, they're more like an OTC medicine. You will feel some tingling as it works.  You will have to be careful of scrubbing your skin too much when you first start using this.  Do not use them in combination with retinol products until you know how both of them effect your skin.  It won't cause any damage or anything, just might cause some unwanted irritation.		Again, this is NOT a miracle drug for deep wrinkles! #There is NOTHING topical on the market that will give you lasting results on deep wrinkles. There are however some products that do work for 3-8 hours.) Alpha Hydrox Souffle WILL help reduce some of the fine lines caused by unhealthy, aging skin."
B000G8LWZI,2007,6,3.0,15,16,45,"A-H makes a less expensive version","This stuff works, but Alpha Hydrox's Enhanced AHA Creme works just as well (despite being a slightly lower percentage of AHA), contains more (2 oz vs 1.6 oz) and costs several dollars less.

B000G8LWZI,2007,2,5.0,11,11,170,"It is true...this stuff works","I saw the reviews, and thought...okay, I will give it a shot. I am 30, fair caucasion, who gets hormonal acne and I have started to notice fine lines, and my pores. I have been using this for almost two months now, and within one week of using this every day, I noticed dramatic results. The lines around my eyes are gone, GONE. The pores are contracted, there is a general smoothness, and that glow is there like others mentioned. I have never been the type to have that perfect porcelain skin, but this definitely makes me feel better about what I do have. I have had one bout of an outbreak of acne since using it, but it was my fault, I got lazy. I highly recommend this product. One more note, I have sensitive skin leaning more towards the dry end of the spectrum, and this did NOT bother it at all. I was waiting for that one, since some people said initially there may be irritation. NONE."

However people should expect that it does cause breakouts initially which is normal and goes deep into the skin's layer to bring up and out excess dirt-hence the breakouts.  But one you are over that small bump in the road it's smooth sailing. I was introduced by a dermatologist to the world of glycolic acid products but also fooled into paying almost $60 for a similar product in the Doc's office. I said never again and this stuff works just as good as the dermatalogist's high priced items.  Both my mother, sister, and boss/co-worker have started using it too after asking if I was wearing makeup one and and I said no. They commented on how nice my skin looked after I had been using this product and they have been buying it since."
B000G8LWZI,2006,8,5.0,9,9,101,"great stuff","This is great cream for those who want an anti-aging and an anti-blemish cream.  It actually even out my skin tone and makes my skin feel nice and soft in the process.  I think my skin actually ""glows"". :-) I noticed the difference within a week.  I have really sensitive skin, if I put on the wrong type of moisturizer or cream, I will break out.  This product doesn't make my skin break out...instead it does exactly what it said it would do.  I am pleasantly surprised.  Plus the price is nice.  This is a great product for my skin type."
B000G8LWZI,2010,2,5.0,6,6,497,"Great stuff!!","Glycolic Acid is the one ingredient that you want your facial products to have.  If you have problem skin such as acne, uneven skin tone, oily skin, dry skin or wrinkles you can count on glycolic acid to fix those problems.  I bought this product because glycolic acid was recommended for my skin by my skin care specialist many years ago.  I have uneven skin texture, oilyness and acne.  I bought some very pricey glycolic acid from her and it did work wonders but the price was way too much for me ($50.00 a jar!).  So ever since I have been searching for something similiar and I think I have found it with the ""Alpha Hydroxy"" line.  And who can beat that price??  When I say I searched for similiar products, I am not kidding.  I have thrown out and gave away (not to mention stored away) so many products that didn't work it is crazy.		One thing you must understand is that you have got to be faithful with this stuff.  Don't skimp and don't skip treatments unless you have a skin reaction.  First you got to get your pores open and a simple pot of steaming water with a towel wrapped over your head should do the trick.  Buy the facial wash and wash your face gently.  Slather this souffle on and go to bed.  You should feel some tingle and that is good because that means you got some open pores and this souffle is sinking in.  If you don't feel the tingle, don't give up on this product!  Keep using this every day and you should see some difference in a week or so.		I can't believe the difference in my skin in only two weeks.  And the amazing part is that I could see a difference in my skin texture within the first few days.  The climate here is very dry and my skin was suffering from being too dry also.  This product fixed that.  AMAZING!  My acne along the jawline is also clearing up a little at a time.  But it is going away and that is a huge relief because this product is working.  The fine lines on my forehead are also slowly disappearing.		One more thing about using this product for acne.  I was watching a infomercial about a new skin care line that is supposed to be better than ProActive (which I have tried and it didn't work).  I wanted to see what the main ingredient was because they did not use benzoyl peroxide.  I couldn't believe it when they said glycolic acid was their main ingredient.  And here we are getting the same benefits with the ""Alpha Hydroxy"" line without having to be bothered with orders over the phone, trial memberships and pushing more products that we don't want or need.		Glycolic acid can be pricey so to be getting a jar for this price is a bargain.  Don't let that cheap price fool you....this stuff works."

B000G8LWZI,2012,11,5.0,2,2,280,"Fantastic product, great price!!","I'm a 37 year old Mom with oily fair skin. I've been trying for years to find a product that will clear up my skin.  My Mom owns a salon and day spa so I've tried over the counter, prescription and spa products. Nothing has been as effective as alpha hydrox lotion and/or the souffle.  Not only has my skin cleared up, but my fine lines have almost disappeared.  I just recently switched to the souffle and I find it to be even better than the alpha hydrox lotion.  I also use the retinol night rescue at night before I put on the souffle.  So that may be helping with the acne and fine lines as well.  The foaming face wash is a great mild cleanser too. However, I find it doesn't remove all of my eye makeup sometimes but probably because it is a mild cleanser.  The cost of these products is very reasonable too!!  Be warned, you will notice a tingling sensation after putting on the alpha hydrox lotion or souffle. This is normal and it means the AHA is working.  Also, be careful if you use a daily cleansers with exfoliating beads or other grainy ingredient.  The AHA is naturally taking off some of that superficial dead skin on the top layer. If you use an exfoliating cleanser daily plus the alpha hydrox lotion or souffle, you could be stripping away too much skin and your skin can become very irritated and possibly break out more. Best to use a mild cleanser when using AHAs and use an exfoliating type cleanser once a week.  Good luck and hope you like this product line is much as me!!"

I will probably now only use weekly or twice weekly now but it did exactly what I wanted for my skin."
B000G8LWZI,2012,8,5.0,2,2,589,"Works as the other 50+ raters have stated...","I have adult onset acne. I have had it for over a decade. Nothing would cure it. Benzyl peroxide makes me break out worse and rash up. >2% salicylic acid spot treatment products help, but nothing really evened everything out and made the acne start to go away. I wouldn't say this is a miracle, but it certainly is the only thing that I have found in the past 10 years that works (and yes I have seen 3 dermatologists for this issue with no permanent resolution).		The Routine:	I apply this glycolic product 1x at night and a light face moisturizer 1x in the morning (plus an eye cream when I remember). I started seeing immediate results within less than 2 weeks. I also, after reading so many scarey reviews about negative product interactions, am happy to report that I had NO additional breakouts with the product and only light tingling for the first few minutes of application. I would compare this tingling to the feeling you get just after applying a witch hazel cotton pad (for those with pain concerns regarding the 'tingle' reported by others).		Regarding Results 2 Weeks In:	For those of us that have had long term acne and know how good we look in summertime (due to the sun hiding your acne spots) this is how I feel now, two weeks later, when I see myself in the mirror. I don't know how well it will treat these recesses (old acne scars) I have in my cheek area, but the red splotches are gone and skin tone has evened substantially.		I also should be honest and say that the use of a glycolic product was recommended to me from my identical twin sister (yay for matching DNA and two people trying to solve the same problem at once). Anyways, she used a similar AHA product for a year (not this one exactly). However, her acne, red splotches, break outs, and scars are completely gone after 1 year of use of an AHA glycolic product. After seeing her results I thought I would find a similar product to try. (keeping fingers crossed over this year!)		Opinion Section:	I saw a number of negative reviews. In reflection, I would suspect that sensitive youth skin may not benefit as much from this product as adult skin. I noticed that the product is far less drying on my face than advertised by others. Heck, I don't even bother to moisturize at night and have no ill over-drying effects. However, I worry that if you are purchasing the product for 'oil control' or have much oil production on your face this may aggravate your acne situation. I only comment this because when I get up in the morning I can still feel this product on my face - it's not greasy or oily, I just feel a sheen. This could explain some of the negative posters comments. In my experience, I think youth acne needs drying more than adult acne, which needs exfoliation. If you are in your mid 20s and up (and DO NOT have sensitive, oil - prone, raging hormone youth skin), then this product is relatively inexpensive and delivers!		PS: If there is a youth out there that has the opposite of this experience, please flag this (if this review section will allow it) to remove this last paragraph for accuracy as i do not want my speculation to mislead people on a product that is in my opinion, from first hand experience, absolutely wonderful."

It will not give you instant results but over time it certainly improves my 40-something skin. I also exfoliate daily with a sugar and olive oil scrub to improve texture. Thanks Alpha Hydrox!!"
B000G8LWZI,2011,6,5.0,5,5,378,"The Real ""Miracle In A Jar"" For Me!","I've been a user of the Alpha Hydrox products for several years. I'm 38 going on 39, and some people still mistake me for 25 to early 30's. I especially love the 12% Souffle cream. Trust me, if you purchase this product, it will work SO well that you may take it for granted someday. Don't! I made that mistake, and it almost cost me my skin!		I had run out of the souffle and was lazy one day when repurchasing my skin care products, so I bought a drugstore brand of a popular new ""Simply Radiant"" skin care system with fancy ""Soy Proteins"" in it. I wanted to even out my skin tone (African-American, with a couple of dark dots left over from a few small pimples). After using the moisturizer for a week, I started developing cystic acne-type bumps on my face!! BIG pus-filled lumps that developed in clusters on my cheeks and forehead. I was horrified. I immediately stopped using the moisturizer, and the cysts stopped developing, but the damage was done; I had slowly-healing cystic acne bumps on my face. When I returned the cream to the drug store, the clerk took one look at me and quickly gave me my money back; the bad skin reaction was that obvious.		I ordered the Alpha Hydrox 12% Souffle as soon as I could, along with the Alpha Hydrox 14% AHA swipes to help accelerate my skin exfoliation. I used the swipes 3 times a week, and the souffle morning and night. After a month, I finally got the acne under control. After two months, my skin was smooth again.  After six months, I was able to take the most gorgeous headshots I've ever had done, and the graphic artist only had to retouch ""shine"" on my forehead and chin. There's only a pinhead-sized indentation left over from the acne scars, and all the deep-colored hyperpigmented spots have completely healed and disappeared. My skin is baby-smooth, even toned, and if I had told you that approximately eight months ago I had deep acne scars on my face, you would never believe me.		I'm back to just the Souffle morning and evening for maintenance, but I'll NEVER take using my Alpha Hydrox products for granted ever again!"
B000G8LWZI,2009,0,5.0,5,5,227,"Wonder cream","I have been using this product for over 20 years.  I first learned about it when I was a college student and saw a segment on a news program that said this product was better than expensive, high-end creams sold at department stores.  At the time, I found it at K-Mart for $7.00.  It is no longer sold at K-mart and I went for a few years without using it.  It was during this period that I realized how wonderful this product was.  When I didn't use the product, my skin looked ""old"" and ""textured"".  Once I found the product again I was amazed at how youthful my skin looked.  I am over 40 and I have flawless skin and do not need to use any foundation to cover any imperfections.  People always ask me for my beauty secret and I also give full credit to my Alhpa Hydroxy from Neoteric.  It is cheap and it is amazing.  I just gave my 15 year old daughter a jar of it and told her to use it on her acne-prone skin.  She came up to me after using the product for a week and said that her skin is so much better.  Now you know that it must work, because it is not often that a 15 year old daughter acknowleges her mother's advice.  Miracle in a jar!!"
B000G8LWZI,2008,7,4.0,4,4,267,"My skin's holy graile","I decided to go the whole 9 yards and try the foaming face wash + 12% souffle + the moisturizer. Just so you know, my skin problems are: Excessively oily skin (need two blotter sheets every hour); uneven skin tone; and clogged pores (disgusting little oil plugs peaking out, some enlarged pores and then those tiny little bumps where the oil plug hasn't hardened yet). I saw immediate results with these products in term of the oiliness and clogged pores. I've only had to blot my face once a day since I started using this stuff - big difference over having to blot every hour.  The enlarge pores and the tiny bumps were greatly minimized. My skin looks  much smoother. I usually use Biore pore strips to remove the plugs so, it is hard to say exactly how effective Alpha Hydros is at getting rid of these. But I don't seem to be developing them as quickly as I was before. Within a week, I saw a noticeable difference in my complexion - much brighter. I don't have wrinkles or zits, so I can't comment on that. But those tiny little clogged pores have been spreading over my face since I was 10! This is the only thing I've used that immediately and consistently improved the condition and appearance of my skin (and the my oiliness) without over drying my face. My skin is actually very supple. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's only been a week. I still have yet to see what the ultimate result will be--but looks promising so far."
B000G8LWZI,2008,8,5.0,4,4,208,"Great affordable tool in skincare","I've been using this product for a couple of months now, along with jojoba oil for extra moisture. This is probably the best product I've bought for my face to date. Alpha hydroxy acid is an exfoliator that works by weakening the bonds between skin cells, thus increasing the cell turn over rate. What does this mean? You'll wake up with fresh new skin revealed. What does this mean in the long run? I don't know. I've been trying to look into medical texts regarding the dangers of using AHA long term. AHA is currently regarded as safe but I wonder whether altering the rate of skin cell production in the long run would cause any harm. What's known though, is that it's IMPORTANT to use sun screen while using this product! Using it will help prevent skin cancer especially when your skin is in such a fragile state.		This product is a somewhat heavy cream, hence souffle and all it takes is a little dab in the pot and onto your skin. Results I've noticed: smoother skin, clearer skin. Wonderful buy. And a little goes a long way. I think it'll be at least a year before I finish the jar. I use it at night, daily."
B000G8LWZI,2011,8,5.0,3,3,150,"Great product for acne","I've been using this product about 3 months now and I'm very pleased with the results. I started getting acne when I got pregnant 11 years ago. I wasted money on many products that never seem to work. I even spend thousands of dollars doing peels, microdermabrasion and buying the expensive products that the spa and dermatology sells along with department stores and pharmacy products. This souffle get rid of my acne and brighten my skin. Not sure how it works on wrinkles as I don't have much to begin with. I love this product so much that I went on their website, bought their toner, 14% aha swipes and night replenishing cream (moisturizer). Best choice I've made in my skin care routine and I'm saving a lot of money. Good bye $109 Chanel moisturizer, hello $10 moisturizer that works just as good if not better. Highly recommend this product!"

B000G8LWZI,2009,3,5.0,3,3,91,"Feel It Working","I'd used the Alpha Hydrox brand in the past, always with great results, but never the 12% solution. Here's the thing: When you put this lotion on you can actually feel it working. There's a mild tingle/burning sensation. And within minutes you can detect a discernible difference in your skin's appearance. If you're looking for a product that tones your skin, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and fades dark circles under the eyes, look no further. This stuff is inexpensive, a jar lasts a long time, and it works absolute wonders."
B000G8LWZI,2008,2,5.0,3,3,79,"Wonderful effective nightcream!","I absolutely love this product. I have acne-prone skin with some fine lines, and has not broken me out. . but more importantly I swear my fine lines are beginning to soften after only a few weeks of use:) You do need to apply moisturizer on top of this though as your skin just sucks it up. Some tingling upon application, so you KNOW it's working! Great stuff. Don't ever stop making this product Alphy Hydrox!!! I LOVE IT!"
B000G8LWZI,2012,11,5.0,2,2,39,"I love it","This lotion really helps keep my skin looking clear.  I have melasma and it is the best lotion I have found to keep it at bay - it even beats out prescription hydroquinone, which I have used for years."
B000G8LWZI,2007,10,2.0,1,3,116,"No results for meI","I tried this after seeing the reviews on the site. I have used this product once daily for well over a month along with the AH cleanser and spf lotion. The other products are nice. The souffle said stinging would be a normal side effect for the first few weeks, so I stuck with it. To this day, the stinging is still intense and I have seen no positive change in my skin. I was hoping that it would alleviate my acne/scars, but I'm breaking out worse than ever. If the stinging or acne does not calm soon, it looks like I'll have to move on to the next product. The Neutrogena Acne system looks promising."
B000G8LWZI,2012,2,5.0,0,2,582,"Can't live without it!","I have had issues with whacky skin since my early 20s - dry and flaky while at the same time oily and acne prone. And now, going into my 30s I'm starting to see some fine smile lines. It's been an ongoing trial and error to find products that combat all of these issues at once. At one point I was using 6-8 products at a time in attempt to get things balanced out (talk about time consuming and expensive). I still use several products, but this was just the icing on the cake. FINALLY, AHA Souffle to the rescue!		Today makes day 20 of using the souffle twice per day. The first day I used it I did notice some very slight burning but this was very insignificant and had subsided within a minute or two of applying. I also noticed that my skin seemed really oily when I woke up in the morning after applying the souffle at night. This has stopped happening going into the third week.		I have maintained my usual skin regime (Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser *not the face wash, just the regular cleanser*, Oil of Olay Regenerist Eye Cream, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MJ7Z0O"">Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz.</a> (this stuff is amazing at 'plumping' your skin up), Clinique Youth Surge Moisturizer with SPF 15 (AM) and Oil of Olay Regenerist Night Cream (PM). I added the souffle into my routine applying it after the hyaluronic acid has time to absorb and then following with the appropriate moisturizer.		So far my skin has improved remarkably - it's crazy to say that a product this affordable works THIS good.		*No more rough patches or bumps - texture is softer, smoother and more even than I ever remember it being.		*Overall more radiant appearance - my skin has a glow and feels more rested, supple, youthful and 'alive'. I find myself going without make-up more often and feeling comfortable in my own skin.		*Significant improvement in blackheads and other pimples - I did have an onset breakout the second day I used this product, but it was not a typical breakout (a few very small bumps, kind of like 'baby acne')- I could tell it was just my skin adjusting and within 2 days, these new blemishes as well as any old ones were completely gone.		*Even tone - There's been at least a 40% decrease in old acne scarring and sun spots, and I'm sure these will continue to fade with time (it's only been a few weeks, after all!).		*Fine lines - moderate improvement with more overall skin firmness. I will continue to watch this and update with changes.		Overall I am still shocked at how wonderful this product works. I am a self-professed 'product junkie'. I have cabinets full of hundreds of dollars worth of skincare products and this one beats out even the most expensive ones I've tried.		One last mention - I had dinner with some friends I hadn't seen in a few weeks and they remarked on how great and 'glowing' I looked and asked what my secret was. That was a huge testimony in itself to the greatness of this product. They had no idea I had changed anything, but could easily tell something was better!		If you're looking for something to give your skin a wake-up call, to be refreshed, brighter, smoother, firmer, and clear - try this! It's too affordable to not give it a try.  I will use this forever!"

After that though, I could see an improvement in my skin. It seemed softer, smoother, and generally nicer. No significant change in the one sun spot I have. Not a bad little product for the price. The two reasons I gave it 3 stars were due to the vast number of white heads I had the first two initial weeks of use. (That was kind of crazy.) And secondly, when I told my dermatologist I was using it, the look of sheer horror and the chastising lecture I received were enough to discourage me from continuing to use it. She said a bath tub of water with a quarter cup of bleach in it would have been less damaging to my skin than this. I can't really smack down the product though since I don't have her medical training behind me. I can only pass on the review."

B000G8LWZI,2012,4,1.0,4,16,243,"cons far outweigh the pros","The glowing reviews about this product are accurate in a sense - yes, this product shows a noticeable improvement in the appearance of skin over a short period of time.  It does contain enough glycolic acid at a decent ph, it does exfoliate well.  Whatever praises people bestow are germane but only to a certain degree.  The fact of the matter though is that the entire line of products contain many unefficacious artificial ingredients at best and downright harmful toxins, in effect, at worst.		It has plenty of potential but does not deliver.  It seems to me that the makers are not truly interested in answering the riddle to great skin.  It is a start devoid of middle or end notes.  It does not cater to the skin as a complete system.  It will give you a minor improvement and waste a lot of your time.		But don't take my word for it, try it for yourself.  If you love it and are happy good for you.  I will not throw cigarette buds on anyones Eden.  If however you are not a believer like me and want to try another alternative try something with ONLY natural ingredients.  Anything else and your skin will be in a constant battle with adversaries you put there, everyday, and leave there to do damage, because it's absurd to think that the body could assimilate such artificiality in any positive long-term way.

I'm afraid this wasn't the best product for me to choose, however. It doesn't contain a sunscreen, for one, so it's not great for the daytime. It does contain salicylic acid, but only .5 percent which is not a great deal, although if you do suffer from dry skin it can irritate it. I have pretty oily skin so that isn't a problem for me, but I also struggle with moderate adult acne and don't feel this is strong enough to really take care of it. I used this for a few weeks in addition to my normal skincare routine and saw no changes.		The lotion goes on clear and dispenses from a pump top for easy application. You get a full 4 ounces for the price.		I would say this product would be great for someone who breaks out with light acne very occasionally, and who is looking for a *nighttime* moisturizer for the oily areas of the face.

This moisturizer works really good for me.  Two  or three times a week, at night, I apply Queen Helene's Mint Julep mask and let it dry for about 30 minutes.  I then wash it off or sometimes use an electric toothbrush (not the one for my teeth!!) and use it to gently massage my face as I wash off the mask with cool water.  I then use this moisturizer every night after washing or using this mask.  In the morning, I wake up, wash my face with warm water and apply some more of this moisturizer.  I did suffer from breakouts constantly, but my face has almost cleared after using these products and my usually oil-drenched face, an hour after showering before, no longer shines--I say about an 90% shine reduction!  I still get a little oily after a few hours but nothing like I've suffered with for the past 15 years! This has helped me feel so much better about myself and less self-conscious when talking to people. Also, along with this, I have been drinking 1 or 2 Emergen-C Vitamin C Acai each day, along with just lots of water throughout the day.  I have always been an avid consumer of water, but I've added the vitamin C recently, which I've heard is really good for your skin. Everything is just working together. This regimen is great and works wonders for my skin! I have finally found just what I needed! I hope others will have the same experience! I got most these products at Walmart and Walgreens. Peace."
B000052YJM,2011,9,5.0,4,5,450,"THE BEST! Better than my own Dermatologist-prescribed acne-clearer","I don't have severe huge white-head acne, but do have moderate acne where my face is pack-full of bumps everywhere. I have tried every. single. lotion/acne-clearer possibly available on the market from the time I was 13 (I am now 22). To make that search all the more difficult, I am incredibly SENSITIVE skin... the kind where I have to be careful to wash my bedsheets with odor-free detergent. Sometimes when putting on shirts (that I wash with a nicely scented detergent) if it touches the side of my face it begins to itch and then I have an allergic reaction in that very spot. I am *that* sensitive. Hence, most of the ""Guaranteed"" products out there made me face swell up like a red water-balloon literally (Proactiv).		I don't know the technical term, but I suffer from a vicissitude of extremely dry & extremely oily skin. My chin and lower half of my cheeks and around my mouth get extremely dry, peel, itch, and then if I itch form red spots, etc. I stress all this as I find it EXTREMELY important when giving this product the review I'm going to give it.	To not digress further, I went to my dermatologist and decided not to use Acutane due to the risks, and was put on Monodox ""as needed"". When I'm breaking out badly, I take one for 2-3 days consecutively and then stop for about a week and repeat the process. So, this is my explanation to explain my acne condition.	As far as MOISTURIZER, I've been so desperate to find the right moisturizer that would help give me that 'soothing' feeling versus itching, stinging, or masking my face with oil. If it stung, it would end up itching after a while, and hence make my condition worse, not better. If it simply felt like a 'masked' feeling in the face, then it simply did absolutely nothing for me and didn't help the dryness at all.		This is the ONE and ONLY topical product I have ever used that's helped me. Not only have I found the absolute perfect moisterizer, but for my personal skin condition, it truly does all it states. I *LOVE* the tingly clean feeling! It's like having mint on your face and walking outside on a cool, crisp morning. It has 0 oil. None. I leave it on for hours and it's perfect. The best thing is that it somehow doesn't irritate my capricious face. I was fed up with my face and bought this on a whim. For the first time in my life, I reached for the save.	I wish I could give it more than just 5 stars.  Very happy customer!"

I went to the dermatologist then and my dermatologist recommended this lotion along with a soap with Salicylic Acid in it to help keep my skin clear. I've used both now for 20+ years and I rarely have break outs.		I have oily skin for the most part so I almost never experience any drying from this lotion and since I'm now in my forties, I use something else around my eyes and for my neck but this works great for my face. I use it after showering, allow it to sink into my skin for about 10-15 minutes and then apply a base, then foundation.		This seems like it keeps my skin bright as well as clear so my complexion doesn't get dull and it doesn't add shiny-ness to my face. In the winter, I sometimes supplement this lotion with something a bit more moisturizing but this is my primary face lotion for the rest of the year. It doesn't make me greasy and leaves my skin soft. I don't know what I would do without it because I've tried switching to more expensive brands but either they don't work as well or eventually my skin begins to break out again.		A bottle of this lasts me a long time too so it's very inexpensive to use. It's a must have in my beauty routine. So long as they keep making it, I'm going to keep buying.		One last thing: If you get breakouts on your back or shoulders or chest, this works great for those areas as well.

I knew I needed a moisturizer because the one I used to use made my skin so oily and shinny. After I wash my face, I put a thin layer of this only on my cheeks, sometimes my chin where I break out most, and under my nose. Surprisingly, this stuff doesn't make my face oily or dry and helps alongside my face wash. I barely use any of this every morning and night so for the price and size, this will last me a long time. I'm glad I finally found a moisturizer which really is oil-free although I wouldn't use it on my nose (my most oiliest spot) but it works great everywhere else.

It can leave a white film, but this goes away if you put your moisturizer on top of it.  You may think you don't need a moisturizer, but you do.  Use something light, preferably with SPF.  Products like Oxy or Neutrogena are creams.  They may appear to sink into the skin, but if you get around any type of moisture (like fog or sweat) your skin will get a nasty white cast to it - that is the filler in the product that makes it 'creamy.'	My favorite is Panoxyl Aqua Gel, but it is hard to find in the store so I switched to Persa-Gel.  It works really well if used consistently.  I used to use it day and night and my skin was perfect.  I'm a bit lazy and only use it during the day now, but still have really great results.  I also use a Clean&Clear acne wash with salicylic acid.

B000052YJL,2011,4,2.0,1,2,292,"Works for other people--but be careful","Apparently this works for other people, but be careful. I do not have sensitive skin, it is actually a tad dark naturally (I'm biracial). I don't have major acne, but a few spots on my complexion that produce a cluster of pimples occasionally, so I got this stuff to spot-treat it. I didn't over use it--actually only dabbed on some once a day for a few days...and first it would dry out the spot really well and the regular pimples I had would start to go away. But then in the very spot I had used it would form a massive pimple--not the kind with the head, but the kind that is extremely swollen and huge and hurts (it feels like something is in pain deep under the skin), almost like a large ""bump""...and then after several days pus would come to the surface, and the whole time it would be extremely sore as if I had pinched it though I had not.		I kept thinking it was ""a coincidence""...and tried it 4 different times on different spots over the space of several weeks...and every time I ended up with a huge deep-underneath pimple that was very painful and leaves a purplish discoloration/scar for several months. I never get those kinds normally.		So I finally concluded my skin was had some kind of allergic reaction to one of the ""inactive ingredients"" in this particular gel (it is not the benzoyl peroxide). So it seems this works great for most people. But be careful--if you develop the same reaction I did, don't keep trying it again and again like I did. Experimental science is great at proving a hypothesis, but don't do it to your face--it'll leave discoloration scars that linger for months."

I have worked in pharmacy for 3 years and have seen people spend a lot of money on prescription acne treatments that basically do the same thing but only cost more, especially if you dont have insurance.  This strength of Benzoyl Peroxide used to be RX only, but now is over the counter.  It is rather strong and I do suggest that  you follow the instructions on the package, especially if you have sensitive skin, to ""ease into it"", even if you are tempted to put it on 2-3 times a day at the very beginning.  It may cause your skin to become very dry and flaky, somewhat ruining the benefits.  Overtime though, many people's skin gets used to it and then you can increase the application as neeed.		As other people have mentioned this product does say that it is a gel, but in fact is a white cream and does leave some residue on the skin.  The good news is that Clean & Clear has just come out with the same product as this in a clear gel!!  I saw it the other day at a Walgreens!		One thing I do have to say though, is that someone previous to me, mentioned that this product is the same as the RX product ClidaGel, which is not true.  ClindaGel contain benzoyl Peroxide, but it alos contains clindamycin which is another acne fighting engredient.  I just thought that I should mention that in case anyone reading this uses ClindaGel.		Overall, this is definately a great product!!!"

I put this on any zit (or blackhead trying to become a zit) that I spy before bed, and it knocks that sucker out.  It does make my skin peel a tad, and it will probably do the same to you, so be careful not to overuse.  Also, make sure you use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer as well if your skin is really sensitive.		EDIT:  Something else that's great:  This product caused old acne scars on my chin to fade very quickly.  Acne scars are the worst because even if the zit goes away it looks like you still have it!  So this product is great for that as well.		SECOND EDIT: I wrote this review several years ago. I'm now 29 and this product doesn't work the same for me as it used to. So your experience with it may vary depending on how old you are. When I was younger, it was the best! Now that I'm older, I find products with tea tree oil work better for me. Also: beware, this product will bleach any fabric it comes in contact with."
B000052YJL,2007,8,5.0,13,14,266,"Works great but a Caution","This product works great. I've been using benzoyl peroxide - based over - the - counter acne treatments for at least 30 years and I'm ordering some more right now. But there is a caution that I should remember, but I recently forgot. Benzoyl peroxide is a bleach (they even use it in Asia to bleach flour, just check the label on your Ramen package). It can bleach literally anything. Recently I ruined a new set of expensive sheets and pillow cases, and left a bleached spot on my new comforter. So now I bought a nice set of white sheets and am trying to find a more color fast duvet cover.		I've also figured out what the small white spots in the carpet are. I've bleached out places in the carpet where I figure the residual on my fingers touched it. (I tend to put the benzoyl on as a final thing after the evening shower while at the bath room sink and in the past I generally haven't washed off the residual on my fingers.) I've determined I was picking something off the carpet or I sat down, using my hand to brace me. Poly/cotton blends seem to be more resistant to benzoyl peroxide than 100% cotton. Although completely man - made blends in the carpet have been bleached. So I'm not sure there is a hard and fast rule.		This would be good for parents to know and to enforce a 'hand washing' rule after use. Or just keep in mind when you find that really nice set of colorful sheets at Overstock."

B000052YJL,2011,7,5.0,5,5,479,"After trying expensive prescriptions - this worked on adult acne!","I rarely review products, but just had to throw out my kudos to this product.  I am a 29 female and have suffered with acne for 15+ years.  It never seemed to get any better, despite expensive prescriptions.  Most of my breakouts were around my jawline and hairline, although no part of my face could really escape it!  For the last two years I have been trying to combat my acne with an expensive combination of antibiotics + birth control + salicylic face wash + aczone ($$!) and retin-a.  Nothing cleared my breakouts.		Thank goodness for my love of amazon and everyone who has used this product and written their reviews! I decided to give persa-gel a shot and with a $5 price tag, I had nothing to lose.		The results are nothing short of AMAZING!! Persa-gel IMMEDIATELY cleared my breakouts, and has prevented new acne.  The first day or two my skin was a little flakey in some spots, but after that no problems.  I have been using this for about 2-3 weeks and have had ZERO new breakouts.  I can run my hands along my face and my face feels smooth (and I can't feel ANY small bumps or clogged pores under the surface!!). I even used this on a small/picked at sore near my hairline that didn't seem to improve after a week or two.  I used persa-gel on it and it IMMEDIATELY began to dry up and heal.  REMARKABLE!  As someone who picks at their skin too much (guilty), I love that this product almost seemed to HEAL my skin.  I love that this product dries out acne, but doesn't make my skin flakey.  Plus it rubs right in clear and very little product is needed.		I am so impressed with this product and recommend it to anyone to try.  I am throwing out all my expensive prescriptions since I have found a new SOLUTION:		Morning:	Wash with Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask with Clarisonic Brush	Use Neutrogena Clear Pore Toner applied with cotton pad	Moisturize with Olay Total Effects moisturizer	Only on occasionally I use persa-gel as a spot treatment on any existing breakouts before makeup (Bare Minerals)		Night:	Wash with Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask with Clarisonic Brush	Use Neutrogena Clear Pore Toner applied with cotton pad	Moisturize with Olay Total Effects Night Firming cream (allow to absorb for 5-15 minutes)	Apply small amount of persa-gel to entire face, concentrating on breakout areas (rub in a small drop on problem areas)		Also taking Zinc (50 mg) + Copper (2.5 mg) nightly		*If you use moisturizer in conjunction with persa-gel, I advise using moisturizer PRIOR to persa-gel and allowing it to absorb for 5-15 minutes first.  I have tried persa-gel first, and even after waiting before applying moisturizer, when I did, some persa-gel ended up getting too close to my eyes and irritating the delicate skin."

This product has cured my acne without aggravating my skin.  I've tried every (pricey) spot treatment under the sun, from Neutrogena to Clarins to DDF, and this product is one of the better ones.		Unfortunately, this product is **NOT A GEL** as advertised!  It is a white cream that can leave splotches as it dries.  I usually apply this after moisturizing so I don't get splotches anyway, but this is something that buyers should know: the packaging is truly misleading."
B000052YJL,2004,8,5.0,4,4,301,"This stuff works if used as part of daily routine","I tried numerous products that were for sensative skin or acne skin. Nothing really worked that well. Nothing until now. Here is my routine and I hope you try it if you have found nothing else that works for back acne.		#1 Wash your skin in mild shower water. Hot water seems to make the oily sebum in your pores more clogging. That is just my opinion.		#2 Get a get body wash loofah.		#3 Get Eucerin Gentle Body Wash and clean your skin. This Body wash contains no acne causing ingredients. Also, It does not try out your skin. I know some of you with acne and oily skin have the feeling that your skin is oily then after a shower with acne body washes you feel like you have dry skin.		#4 Use Johnson & Johnson PersaGel with Benzoyl Peroxide after you get done with your shower. Benzoyl Peroxide sloths off any remaining dead skin cells and opens up your pores. This in turn makes your skin clear in the long run. Believe you me, the results I have found using the above routine has given me enough confidence to walk around with no shirt on in a locker room and not feel ""dirty"" for the first time since I was 15.		One last note. I have found that if you mix the gel with a little bit of water or even apply the gel straight to your skin out of the shower it works even better. The water dilutes the gel so it won't burn at all. Sometimes with 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Max strength it can burn skin. Again, use it on wet skin with a diluted PersaGel and you will be better off because the Gel works just as good and then will not burn at all."

I find the best routine is to clean your skin with a mild soap at night and apply a thin layer all over (it really helps prevent).

I can put harsh products on my face usually without having redness, irritation, or peeling. When I saw all the good reviews on Clean & Clear Persa-Gel, I knew I had to try it. I figured if it worked to clear and prevent one pimple, why not try to clear up my entire face. I have recently developed cystic acne and it has been very debilitating. I first apply Clean & Clear Pera-Gel to my entire face (twice a day) and then immediately after I apply Neutrogena's Combination Skin Moisturizer. I should also say that before applying the Persa-Gel, I use Oxy Maximum Facial Cleanser. I really do believe it is the Persa-Gel that has worked the biggest miracle for my face. ALL, I mean ALL, of my acne is gone. It has lightened my complexion, gotten rid of some tough acne scars, and my face always feels smooth and hydrated. I have tried other products with less benzoyl peroxide and for some reason they always dried my face up. This combination REALLY works! Make sure you use a great moisturizer immediately following the application of the persa-gel and lather that moisturizer on pretty good to avoid dryness.

NEVER use this more than a couple of times a day as it can seriously dry out your skin.		My regime for facial care consists of CeRave hydrating cleanser, followed by a Clean & Clear 10% benzoyl peroxide wash and then applying facial moisturizer(oil free preferably) and then the Clean and Clear Persa-Gel 10. Do this twice a day, preferably after a shower as the hot shower will open up your pores.		NOTE: This product doesn't help reduce/prevent acne, this is just to get rid of current acne.

People say tea tree oil works, but even when I burned my whole face with it, 10 huge inflamed acne would appear on my forehead and more on my nose bridge and cheeks. Not only did I start to hate looking at the mirror, my face hurt like there were bruises. Those who suffer from severe acne understand this feeling.		I searched on Amazon for hours and read hundreds of reviews. Because I read that benzyl peroxide is the best treatment for inflamed acne, I added this product to my cart. It's only been 2 days and the result is almost instant. I woke up the next morning after I applied the product and my inflamed acne noticeably shrank. This morning, I woke up and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The acne were not red anymore, so although I still had small bumps, they were not noticeable at all. I know that after a couple more days, my life with painful acne will end.		The Witch Hazel toner I use, I believe, prevents more inflamed acne from appearing and also completely cleanses the pores.		As for the whiteheads, I believe the salicylic acid gel peel helped because it peeled the whiteheads without me having to pop them or have them for a long time. I will write a review on this, so look it up on Amazon and check it out! It also has great reviews.		I've never written a review but I remember wanting to see just one review by someone with severe acne like me, not with small pimples that could disappear the next day with good cleansing. I hope a lot of people see this review and try this product.		HUGE ADVICE	-Don't go to the dermatologist if you have acne like mine because this kind of acne cannot be cured with laser or popping. You will only end up with a red, bloody face and with more acne the next day.	-Always put on sunblock. I know a lot of people think putting on sunblock will clog the pores and cause more breakouts, but in reality, the sun will cause even more. I learned this the hard way. The sunblock I use is Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46. I haven't tried it on yet because I just got it a few days ago and I didn't want to go out with my acne face. I will use it today now that I am more confident with my skin, so I will definitely write a review on the sunblock in a few days. You can read the reviews from other users now. A lot of people say it's amazing and good for acne-prone skin.		UPDATE 10/6/2012: I stopped using this for awhile and switched to using tea tree oil but the oil made my inflamed acne worse, so I recently switched back to the Clean & Clear Persa-Gel. I am not switching back to any other treatment again! I realized what I've been doing wrong this whole time. A lot of acne websites told me to apply a bunch of the creme on my acne overnight, but this only made it worse because the skin also need to breathe. I started putting just thin layers until the creme is not visible and my skin is getting so much better again!!"

I used a small amount once on Tuesday around my chin and mouth area (and a small spot on my temple) and another small amount once on Wednesday and didn't notice any difference.  I decided to stop using it (thankfully) and by Friday morning, when I woke up, my face was really itchy around my mouth and chin and was red (I also had a slight itch on my temple).  I emailed the company and got a response on Saturday to call them during the week.  My *rash* got progressively worse over the weekend, it turned very bright and got extremely itchy and got bumpy.  It even started oozing for two days.  I called the company immediately on Monday and was told that a nurse would be in touch with me very soon.  By Tuesday afternoon I was tired of waiting and called to see if a nurse was ever going to call.  I was placed on hold for a long time and ended up hanging up.  I went to Target and spoke to a pharmacist that recommended putting Aveeno Positively Radiant daily moisturizer on the area twice per day.  I have actually been putting it on about 5 times per day (it hurts and itches and I just want it gone) and less than 48 hours later the rash and redness is going away and it barely itches anymore.  I will not buy Clean & Clear products again because of this experience.  I would much rather have a face covered in acne than go through this again!!!"
B000052YJL,2011,6,5.0,1,1,249,"This product is incredible!","I developed acne a year ago after I got married and stopped taking the BC pill.  I lead a very healthy lifestyle and make my living as a yoga instructor and holistic nutritional counselor so having cystic-like acne all over my forehead and cheeks while I'm trying to be the picture of good health is quite bad for business.		I prefer to use natural products on my skin, but have made an exception for Persa-Gel.  After less than a week of using the product, I have seen a huge difference in my skin. My husband even asked me what I had been doing differently as my face is starting to look so much better.		I have found what works best for me is to use the Persa-Gel before bed as part of my night time cleansing routine.  I cleanse with a  mild tea-tree oil based soap, then depending on what my skin looks and feels like, I tone with witch hazel then apply an aloe based moisturizer. After all that, I apply a thin layer of Persa-Gel all over my skin adding a bit extra to the more severely broken out areas.  I have been doing my nighttime routine for years and all that has changed recently is the addition of the Persa-Gel so I know that it is this product that is making the difference.

Nothing would cure the swelling, I looked sick, and I tried ice, hot tea bags, frozen cucumbers, etc. all the classic home remedies...nothing.

This product is a superb choice for people who want clear skin. It goes on moist, but quickly dries into a mask-like protective layer (to dry out your skin).

It does tend to bleach fabrics, so make sure to wash your hands after use, and you'll probably want to have white sheets/pillowcases while using this product. One tube lasts me several months, and I've been using this for several years. It works best if I exfoliate in the shower right before, using a face wash with exfoliating beads such as an apricot scrub. I notice a marked increase in pimples when I neglect to use this product for several days in a row, so it definitely helps. I had a friend staying over that used this on her chronic acne, and after just one overnight application her face was noticeably clearer and any remaining pimples were much smaller.	This product doesn't cause those hard pimples for me, like other reviewers have said it causes them. It doesn't cause my skin to peel or dry out, but my skin is somewhat oily to begin with. If you use a lot, it can leave a white residue, but I use a small amount and rub it in so this isn't a problem for me. If you're worried about having a reaction, don't put it on your face first! Try it on the inside of your elbow. I'd also recommend using a sunscreen over this if you plan on wearing it during the day, because sun and benzoyl peroxide don't mix well."

Also, if your skin starts to peel, please pause the application of this product. If you continue to apply it excessively, it will make your skin flake. Lastly, I noticed that one of my pimples actually turned very hard. After several days, the ""pimple"" would not go away. Thus, I had to peel off the scab and decided to see what was going on. I ended up squeezing the area and out popped a VERY hard whitehead. I don't know if this product made the pimple byproducts (which was one of those pimples from deeper within the skin) to get stuck underneath the skin and solidify but if this happens to you (the area gets very hard and is a raised bump), I would recommend that you extract the material somehow using some kind of a pimple extractor tool, and follow that up with this product.

Don't buy this product intending it to make a pimple vanish in a day, it's not magic. I use it everyday on difficult blemishes that woudn't go away, and about 4-5 days later it was gone. If I would have left it alone to heal, it would have gone away longer in about 1-2 weeks. It comes in a little tube, but I've found that even using it everyday, one tube will last a long time.

This product was one of them.  I have sensitive, oily acne prone skin, and this product didn't irritate my skin at all.  I only use it as a spot treatment.  I apply it directly to the pimples instead of entire areas of my face.  Since then, my skin has cleared up entirely.	I would definitely recommend trying this product out."

I've had acne for years and have used harsh abrasive cleaners, creams that dried my skin out, creams that irritated, and creams that did nothing at all.  When I turned 25 I imagined my skin would clear up, but it never did.  Then came 30, 33, 36...and the acne was still there, not as bad, certainly, but still an issue.  Then I found this, and my life changed!  This product WORKS...and I won't be without it.  As I said, the only thing that could make it better is if I had it with me the week before the PROM!		If your teenager suffers from acne, they just don't need to.  Give this a try, and I think you will see results fairly quickly.  It works for me just about overnight!		Thank you Neutrogena!"

I noticed that a few pimples, that I could tell wanted to turn into giant monsters, were suppressed.  They still haven't gone away completely but they haven't gotten real big or irritated.  But then I have another breakout that I've been applying this on, and it drys my skin out so much that my skin peels and the acne opens up, but then it never goes away.  In a few days the breakout is just where it started, only my skin there is ugly and irritated.  My acne can't decide if it wants to go away or become big and ugly, so for the most part it just hangs out.  I haven't noticed an awesome improvement with this.  For someone who has minor acne, this may work just fine.  For someone like me who's cursed, this probably isn't the best answer, but it's always worth a shot.  Everyone has different skin, hormones, etc. so ya never know.	It gets two stars because it did seem to prevent a few pimples from becoming huge and unsightly."

It did redden and dry the spot a bit. However, recently I learnt that the best way to get rid of acne is to use benzoyl peroxide regularly over the entire problem area. So I started doing that with this cream and it works great. I havent had any acne for a whole week. :) and it doesnt redden the area if used with a moisturizer.

B000052YJX,2011,4,5.0,1,2,444,"Great to use all over!","I use this product second in my regime; I first use Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser, then this, then finish off with Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer. I did a lot of research and found this to be the best B.P. product on the market. It is 2.5% B.P and this is the amount you need in a product, if you go over that it is much too harsh for your skin (especially mine because it is sensitive). Obviously if you have severe acne and need medication type products, that might be different for you. But for the average face, anything over 2.5% B.P is much too harsh. I actually don't buy this product on Amazon I just buy it at my local WalMart and it is about the same price on Amazon, minus the shipping charge. I'd say it's a pricey little product for the small tube you are getting, especially the way I use it all over my face but, hey it works and that's why I stick to it. The other two products I use last months and aren't that expensive for how long they last so I can afford to use this product. While it says it is an ""On the spot"" treatment, I actually use it all over my face. Because it is not a gel and it is creamy, you can't really apply it all over your face then rub it in, you'll have to apply a small amount to your finger and apply in batches. I don't find this annoying or hard to do, though some might because it takes a bit longer. When I first started using this product I only applied a small amount to my face in certain spots to get my skin used to it. Progressively over 2 weeks I began to use more and more and my skins takes it like a champ now. Even though it is a B.P. product, I actually don't get the stiff feeling after applying it all over my face. It also does not leave a white residue as other creamy products might do, it is a little difficult to work in if you're using small amounts but it goes on well. I find that it clears my skin up well but of course I get an occasional pimple or so due to that time of the month or stress or whatever, but much less than I used to! I always let this soak in for about 10 minutes or so before I put on my moisturizer. Overall, a small tube of the product and a bit pricey but it works and I would reccommend it for the average face!"

Benzoyl peroxide works the best for me.  It is most effective when applied directly to your acne.  It starts to work right a way.  In a matter of days, you will see a reduction on the size of your acne.		Once my face I got used to it, I start applying a thin layer all over my face to prevent the spread of new acne.  I apply it once a day at night.  When applied it leaves a whitish marking all over your face, especially if you also apply moisturizers.  Trust me you need moisturizers as it dries your face and makes it sensitive to UV light, but no adverse reaction.  That's why I apply it at night.  In the morning, I only dab a little amount directly at my acne.		If all else fails, try benzoyl peroxide, just be careful because some people have an adverse reaction to it."

It is very red, and the skin is swollen and it feels like a burn.  About half my forehead is affected as well as several more large patches on the rest of my face.  I didn't apply a heavy coating of this cream at all.  I applied a few drops of this cream.  Wearing makeup at work was a royal pain - and very uncomfortable.  I'm very concerned about this as it seems to be getting worse.  My skin is not typically this sensitive - if you have sensitive skin, be very careful in trying this product!!

This works if you use it just like the directions say: on clean skin, once a day initially then increase to several times daily. On day two I use it like every 2 hours.		It makes the pimple or, in my case, underground monster, less visible and less irritating. It gets rid of any pain or soreness that makes me want to pick and pop. After day two it completely disappears.		Honestly, the best thing about this product is that it makes me keep my hands OFF my face which is likely why I break out in the first place.

After use, I would develop a red, hot, itchy rash in about two days. Then the area would become rough and dry.		So if you have a sensitivity or had this problem before, this is what worked for me.		Apply a small (I mean small, like a pen tip) of the cream to the pimple with a q-tip and dab. Only to the actual pimple and dont rub it around or get it on any surrounding skin. The pimple will look so much better by morning. Also dont apply moisturizer over the areas which you applied the cream because you'll spread the residual cream over the rest of your face and end up with a rash. That happend to me.		Good luck!"

I looked up a lot of advice and recommendations on the web and decided I would try this on-the-spot treatment. It works very well, and my face cleared up drastically overnight. The only thing I do not like is the thickness of the product when applied to the face and the rate at which it dries. I read that it dries quickly, because it is a cream instead of a gel, but I didn't think it would really dry that quick-it does. You have to put it on very quickly and purposefully, or else it will dry up and you won't be able to apply it evenly. It also leaves my face feeling like I have a mask on, but I am willing to deal with that because of the outcome. I also wish it came in a larger quantity, but it was nice to not have to buy a small quantity for the first time trying it in case it did not work for my face type.

B000052YJX,2005,9,5.0,10,13,325,"Product DOES work but takes time","First off, I use Clean & Clear Persa-Gel 10 every once in a while for really demanding blemishes; it seems to dry them out - REALLY dry them out - much quicker.  And I guess this is really the reason I don't use it on a regular basis.  It's just too drying, and I have oily skin.  (I can only imagine what it would do to dry skin.)  Anyway, it does work.  Don't get me wrong.  But you'll probably end up peeling and just really, really dry; so, be prepared.		What I love about THIS particular product (Neutrogena) is that it essentially packs the punch of Persa-Gel 10 without drying your face out.  And I guess the way it does this is that because it has a lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide, its effectiveness is spread out over a longer period of time; the results are not as immediate.  Persa-Gel on the other hand, is so strong that yes it works faster, but the downside is that it'll dry you out.  And recovering from that will take days.		On another note, what really sold me on Neutrogena's product was that it was in fact made by Neutrogena.  Why is this important you ask?  Well.  Neutorgena also manufactures Retin-A Micro (Tretinoin Gel), which is a godsend for acne sufferers.  It is available by prescription only.  (Imagine that... a Neutrogena product you'd need a prescription for.)  Anyway, if Neutrogena's good enough for my dermatologist to prescribe me Retin-A Micro, which she has done; then, it's good enough for me to trust an over-the-counter, on-the-spot benzoyl peroxide treatment.		Then again, it's Johnson & Johnson that owns BOTH Neutrogena and Clean & Clear (the manufacturers of Persa-Gel).		Nevertheless, both products are great, and they work.  Just know that one is going to dry you out more than the other; so, if you're looking for a long-term regimen, definitely invest in Neutrogena's On-the-Spot Treatment.

It works super fast and my pimples are slowly vanishing only after 2 days of application!		My skin isn't sensitive and this is my first time using benzoyl so I was afraid of its side effects and I'm glad that I've experienced none, also this product has only 2.5% of benzoyl unlike others like acne free etc that has 5% to 10 %.		I'm using this in conjunction with the Neutrogena 3 in 1 hydrating acne cream ( which is great for moisturizing but isn't strong enough to kill pimples by itself ) and I'm getting amazing results with both uses.

I tried many different products (understatement) and this is the only one that is gentle enough not to turn my skin into a desert wasteland, yet effective enough to actually start reducing the redness and healing the pimple almost right away. Please however use WHITE pillows unless you are looking for a tie die look. Also use a moisturizer over it if going into the sunlight."
B000052YJX,2012,7,2.0,0,0,139,"Not showing any effectiveness","Ive used this from time to time over the past month or so to essentially no avail. The product did not diminish any bump I put it on.		My acne is by no means severe so a simple astringent such as witch hazel with a neutrogena facial cleansing bar is all I use to minimize breakouts. The cream I would use to apply at night on the one or two bumps that occasionally appeared. However, all that would come of my effort was dried-up cream when I awoke in the morning where I had applied over the bump. Not sure if it takes a few days for the bump to disappear or if I should have been applying every night until it reduced, but I did not. I used the product once per pimple. Again, to virtually no difference."
B000052YJX,2012,7,5.0,0,0,379,"In love with this product","I've struggled with adult acne for about three years now. I tried so many over the counter products that I was at the point of giving up. Most were expensive, dried my skin out and didn't end up working. I was stuck wearing a pile of makeup on my face, which just made the acne worse but with how bad it was I had no option. As a college student I couldn't afford really expensive treatments like proactiv.  Then I saw this on the Walmart shelf, it said dermatologist recommended and I figured it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. I'm so happy I did! After about two weeks I started seeing my acne decrease, after a month I didn't even need the makeup anymore. I've been using it for a few months now and it's kept my acne away which in turn is helping my acne scars heal. I use it on problem areas once a day or every other day if my skin is being good. I'll use more if I start noticing a bump since once in a while I will get small pimples here or there because of heat, stress or hormone changes. But when I notice one coming up I apply the creme in that area two or three times that day and by the next day its healing up already. Never lets it get out of control. It's really cheap, easy to use and effective. I use it at night before bed, wash my face with Neutrogena Foaming Scrub Deep Clean (has no acne medication), apply the acne creme to clean dry skin and lastly I pat a small amount of moisturizing lotion to prevent dryness. I would really recommend this to anyone suffering from acne. Everyone's skin is different so I can't say it'll work for everyone but at $5 the bottle at Walmart, it's worth a try. Just give it some time to start working, it's not instantaneous and if it starts drying your skin use a facial moisturizer or lotion.		Pros:	-Very cheap	-Bottle lasts over a month (if it's used by a single person)	-Works well (gets rid of acne and prevents it)	-Simple to use		Cons:	-Can dry out skin (nothing a simple moisturizer can't fix though)"

I washed my face like normal twice a day and covered the pimple with this. After a day, it was gone! It wasn't red and puffy anymore, and with a little make-up was nonexistant!

Only problem was, a week after using this product, I began breaking out in a rather itchy rash and had to use hydrocortisone to get rid of it. I purchased this product in hopes of it working, which it did, but it caused a bigger problem and I had to walk around with a red, itchy face until it went away.

It was my first time using one with benzoyl peroxide so I was worried how my sensitive skin would react. As the fine print warns, I experienced minor redness, itching, and peeling and the initial result looked worse than the pimple I was trying to treat. My skin became used to it and now I'm able to apply it up to 4-5 times a day without experiencing any adverse reactions. However, I only use it on single pimples and not on larger areas. It doesn't make them disappear over night, but they definitely don't grow as red or large as they would without On-the-Spot and I see them going away faster."

B000052YM3,2013,0,5.0,1,1,435,"Amazing stuff","There aren't many things that work for everyone, so don't be discouraged by any contrary reviews. This stuff is amazing.Im am 33 years old, don't drink much water...smoke, all of that stuff that's bad for your skin.Ive had acne of varying degrees my whole life and as an adult, it's the nasty cystic kind. I'm a light skinned multi racial woman and the pigment in my skin marks every scar and bump.I have hereditary large pores.Just lots of fun stuff going on!	I discovered Alpha hydrox about 6 years ago and it's always worked.Im lazy, so once my skin is flawless I just don't worry as much. From now on, Ill stick with this stuff because its the only thing that can make my skin look great!	I like this formula the best. The concentration is just right.When I first started using  this years ago, I went through the rough part before the calm.Often your skin will get worse before its gets better, when you are exfoliating like this.I find that my acne errupts as the skin slouches away( not as harsh as it sounds, it's just the exfoliation) and then once it's gone, I'm left with beautiful clear skin.	Well a few months ago I was getting pretty discouraged by my skins condition.I use foundation to cover my bad skin and then the foundation makes it worse.Its a cycle.But I've found the perfect balance.I wash my skin well at night and then apply thisin the morning, wait about 10 minutes and THEN apply my foundation. It's amazing what it does.Within minutes your pores are smaller and skin smoother.I notice that I need less foundation and that it's easier to apply.I believe by using this first, it closes my pores letting less foundation clog.It's just overall an 1000% improvement.	Well when I ran out of my last bottle( this is my second this time around), I noticed the difference right away.And in the three days I was out, a break out occurred.Only because cystic acne is my underlying issue.	With long term use skin is lighter, clearer and smoother.Trust me, this is an excellent product.	If it doesn't work for you, your problem isn't a buildup of dead skin needing exfoliation. And if your skin gets a bit worse before it gets better, remember what I've said.Its just the bad stuff coming closer to the surface and soon it will be gone leaving behind beautiful skin.It takes about 1-4 weeks to go through a cycle.This time around, the bad cycle wasn't bad at all.So the less exfoliation you need, the less it effects your skin."
B000052YM3,2012,11,5.0,1,1,154,"Get Rid of Fine Lines","I've definitely noticed a difference after using this product - especially right out of show or after exfoliating. I have been using this product for about 2 months now, and have noticed more of a &#34;glow&#34; to my skin, and a reduction of fine lines. It does burn/sting when you first put it on, I have sensitive skin and definitely felt the prickles the first time I have used this - nothing intense or painful, but you should be aware.		Value - I have found a very small amount of this cream goes  a LONG way, which is nice. A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly, so it's great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time. One caution is to make sure to use sun screen with this product as it can make your skin more susceptible to the sun."
B000052YM3,2012,9,5.0,1,1,197,"Tried and True","I absolutely love this stuff. They used to sell the 12% Alpha Hydrox cream at Walgreen's but they don't carry it anymore. I learned years ago when I first started using it that the best concentration for an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) is between 8% to 12% and the ideal pH is 3 to 4. You can use a pH test strip to check the pH. The Alpha Hydrox cream has a concentration of 10 and a pH of 4. The souffle works well too but the cream is cheaper and works exactly the same. I've tried other alpha hydroxy acids in the past with a higher concentration of AHA but the pH was too high to make it effective. The higher the pH, the greater the buffer and that reduces the strength of the AHA and renders it useless. I've been using this brand for years although I've occasionally tried others. I haven't found anything yet that does a better job for the price. It really does help keep the wrinkles away. I don't often reveal my age but when I do tell people I'm 55 years old, their jaws literally drop. Makes me feel great!"

I'll continue to use, because it's certainly not doing any harm, but I probably won't repurchase (unless my skin all of a sudden takes a sharp turn for the better)."

I ended up using it for a while on my face too and it helped a lot. It does burn a bit on the face though, just make sure you use a good moisturizer afterwards. Once I ran out I stopped using it and even now a few months later my back and face continue to stay clear with just the use of clean and clear face soap and moisturizer. It seems to me that this product helped thoroughly clean out and open up my pores to the point that they are no longer clogging up. I will definitely be using this product again as the need arises."

I have dry skin, and I even used to have dry patches on my cheeks, which didn't look good at all, especially with makeup. This creme does make skin much smoother, and much fresher. It is not scented- it has a little bit of unpleasant chemical smell, but it's very faint, and you can't smell it on the skin (and I'm super sensitive to smells).	It stings quite a bit when you first start using it, and my skin looked pretty red too, but that doesn't last more than 15 minutes. Also, the first week or two after I started using this moisturizer I started to break out a little- that is a temporary effect too. I guess, this is how this stuff works- that must be some sort of cleansing process for the skin. Now that I've used this for about a month my skin is MUCH smoother and is much more clear, I can even skip the foundation, but if I do use foundation it goes on nice and smooth.	I have been using Alph Hydrox nourishing cleanser with this. For daytime use, I apply just a thin layer of this creme, wait for about 5-10 minutes, and apply my spf moisturizer, and then makeup (sunblock is  a must after this product, cause AHA is an exfoliator, and makes your skin more sensitive to UVA/UVB). For night use if my skin feels dry, I sometimes apply some Alpha Hydrox nourishing night creme (it doesn't contain AHAs).	I'm not sure if this does much for lines and wrinkles- first, I don't have many, and I haven't used this long enough, but this creme does a wonderful job for dry skin with patches, and for uneven skin, through faster renewal, and dead skin cell removal.	I definitely recommend this product, it's a great, truly effective creme, and you can't really beat the price!"

The difference is the 10% version costs less and contains 2 oz, while the 12% version is only 1.6 oz and costs more. I guess you're paying for the word 'souffle' -- in actual look and texture, there is no difference between the two. I used the 10% for nearly 10 years, then switched to the 12% about a year ago. The more expensive 12% version worked no better than the less expensive 10% version. I'm going back to the 10% stuff.		I'm only giving it 4 stars because I still think the cheaper version is more expensive than it needs to be.

I first got my hands on my mom's when I was about 10 and managed to burn the h*** out of my eyes.  :)  But shortly after that I would occasionally use it and after just a single use the results were visible: clear, smooth, porcelain skin.  It helped clear all my acne scars and is keeping wrinkles at bay.  I usually use this product for about a month at a time and then I begin to use it again when my skin appears to need it.  If you are someone who will not go out without makeup, this can really help you feel more comfortable in your own skin.  A thin layer of this and a little under eye concealer could be all you need and what a great feeling that is.		I used to use a store brand AHA cream but this product is worth the few dollars extra.  The store brand I tried just didn't absorb as well as this product which is very important so that it does not get into your eyes while you sleep.		Please be advised to apply this lightly, especially if you are going to be leaving the house!  If you apply a layer which is too thick to be absorbed, your skin will temporarily (for about 30 minutes or so) turn tomato red!

B000052YM3,2008,7,5.0,10,11,326,"I Love This Creme!!!","I started using this creme about 6 weeks ago when I realized my 51-year old face needed more maintenance than it was getting.  I'm a Florida native with blonde hair and fair skin, so after a lifetime of sun my face had issues with some sunspots and a blotchy complexion.  I don't have problems with breakouts and only have a few faint ""laugh line"" wrinkles that I'm not worried about yet so this review won't address those issues.		Since I can't afford constant facials I did some research and developed my own skin-care regimen.  Exfoliating dead skin cells is important so I decided an AHA product would be useful and ordered this creme and began using it most nights after washing my face.  I leave it on anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then use an eye cream and moisturizing lotion.  I had some very mild tingling the first time I used it but nothing after that - if you have sensitive skin you might want to try the 8% version first and work your way up to the 10%.		After doing this for about 6 weeks I can see a definite difference in my skin that can't be attributed to just the moisturizing.  The sunspots are still there (and always will be) but they are much, much lighter and less noticeable.  The blotchiness has evened out considerably and I feel like I could run up to the store without makeup and not worry about frightening small children.  [...smile...]  As I said, I don't have much in the way of wrinkles so I really haven't noticed whether this has done anything to clear them up or not.  I doubt any skin product will do anything for serious wrinkles anyway, and if that's your worry you'll need to look into some kind of doctor or aesthetician's services.		I highly recommend this product for anybody who wants to get serious about taking care of their skin."

B000052YOB,2010,7,4.0,5,6,345,"MUCH Better than Store Brand","I bought a small tube of this after having total knee replacement. I was miffed at the high price, but had been told by my doctors that this was what I should buy. After using it for a couple of months, and running out, I wasn't happy with the slow progress I was making. So when I went for a refill, I bought the Walgreens store brand instead since it was much cheaper. After only a few days, the scar was worsening - growing in both height and width. I ordered this large tube on Amazon, and I immediately exchanged the store brand for another tube of Mederma, and the scar is back on track for a slow resolution. My doctor said to be patient; the larger the scar, the longer the treatment time will be.		Update Oct. 14, 2010:  I'm uploading a picture today so everyone can see the progress of my scar. As you can see, I scar badly. My doctor told me that using Mederma, it would start at one end and zip up like a zipper - and as you can clearly see, that is what's happening. Getting this far has taken a LONG time. I've been using it liberally for about 5 months now, and spent $60 on the stuff so far. Before this thing is over, I will have invested a lot of time, money, and patience.		Update March 14, 2011:  It has now become evident that the Hypertrophic part of the scar on my knee (the upper half of the scar) is not benefiting from using Mederma. Mederma slows the progression of the condition, but I don't plan to use it my entire life, so ultimately it will progress and end wherever it wants. My conclusion is that it was very helpful for the normal part of the scar - the part that didn't go Hypertrophic at the outset - but ultimately failed to reverse the Hypertrophic condition. Most people don't scar as I do, so it may be beneficial for them to use on their ""normal"" scars."

However, I did want to warn those with sensitive skin who are interested in using Maderma on their face. After using Maderma for a few days on a scar on my forehead (curling iron!), the area now becomes very itchy whenever the product dries after application. And because it's itchy, I inevitably scratch or rub the area, which results in the product FLAKING off like dead skin. It's pretty unattractive and sort of embarressing at work.		It's not CRAZY itchiness, like other reviewers have said, but it's annoying. I think that I'll probably keep using it, but only at home or when I know I won't be seen in public. :)"
B000052YOB,2012,7,1.0,2,2,148,"There is no scientific proof Mederma works","Okay, so, before researching this product at all, I was using it, because of all the hype and ads on TV. Whenever I had a big scar or one I wanted to fade fast I would purchase Mederma, use it for a few months straight, and quit in disappointment. And I never noticed a difference; scars took just as long to fade with Mederma or without.		Well, to put it bluntly, there have been very few trials with Mederma and of those, one found no significant difference of Mederma vs. placebo, and one found effective results... in rabbits.		Well, the active ingredient in Mederma is onion. So, maybe save your money and apply diluted onion juice !		Silicone sheets (and to a lesser extent gels) have really helped my scars and there have been many studies showing their effectiveness. Vitamin E, Mederma, etc though  are just snake oil."

A small amount really does go a long way but even so I'm still having to use a 3 pack every month due to the huge area I have to cover. I am a male who served in Iraq and I got very sick after being out in the dust storms and caught pneumonia. I lost 70 pounds in 2 months, and 30lbs of it was lost in the first 2 weeks. I was deathly ill and couldn't get any treatment for it and after regaining the weight I now have a belly full of probably 50 major scars from my thighs to my lower chest. Until recently it was a terribly embarassing sight, but after 3 months they are noticeably lighter. What used to be dark red and highly visible across the room is now light pink and only visible if viewed up close or if I stretch them out. I'm hoping at the end of the 6 months that they will be all but gone and I trust I will be Very happy with my investment. They are quite severe stretch marks (they are 8 years old and some are a full inch wide) so I'm not under the illusion that they will completely vanish, but if they even turn grey and blend in with the skin like normal stretch marks do then I'll be happy--and it appears to be going in that direction at a steady pace."

It looked awful, and sometimes in the middle of my workday I would feel it bleeding. (Pretty!) I was deeply skeptical of a product I could buy OTC, but none of the prescription medications I have (including Biafine, which is more expensive even with insurance) had worked, either. Six nights ago I bought some Mederma at the drugstore. I rubbed it liberally on my nose, as well as on a mole I recently had removed on my chest. A day later, after having applied Mederma four times, both scars were noticeably paler, smaller, and less angry. The scrape on my nose is reduced to a pin prick, and it was easly 3/4 of an inch just last week. The surgical scar on my chest has gone from an itchy, swollen welt to barely there. I have oily skin that flares with hormones, and I often break out on my nose and chin.

Same with Vitamin E and all the other products. According to the article (which quotes recent studies), its merely the fact that all these products keep the scar moist. That is the mechanism that Mederma, Vitamin E, etc work better than letting the scar heal by itself. Studies clearly show no benefit in using scar products (with one exception - silicone gel) versus plain old petroleum jelly. So just clean your cut with simple soap and water (anti-bacterial gels and soaps don't help other than to make you more resistant to anti-biotics, so they are actually a detriment!!!) and put petroleum jelly on it followed by a band-aid. Neosporin and the like are a waste of money. (This has actually been known for a long time and is not the point of my review. There's plenty of science to back this point up if you research it.) The one thing worth buying is silicone gel treatments like Scar-Away, that originally came as gels for burns, and can now be bought as sheets attached to a band-aid like backing. And the best part is that silicone gel products work great on old scars. Scar-Away is just one brand of many, so do your own research to see if one brand is better or cheaper than another. I hope this helps you save money and that you scars heal nicely."

When I first heard of Mederma I was skeptical that it would reduce the visibility of the scars that I've had for years, but I was so sick of seeing myself as 'scarface' when I looked in the mirror I was willing to give anything a shot. After I first began using the product, that area of my face began to turn red and it would flake off after about a half hour of application. I've been using Mederma for about 3-4 weeks now and the redness from using the product has stopped and best of all, the scars on my face caused by acne have been greatly reduced! I am going to continue to use Mederma for about another month but until that time I'm proud to say I'm not near as embarrassed in public, and I don't have to worry about showing my 'good side' any more.

It finally went away after taking a 2 month cycle of acne medication.	However, I was left with scars on both sides of my face from me picking and popping pimples. I assumed that after a month or two that these scars would fade away. Not so! I tried to cover them with makeup, but that wasn't working so I turned to Mederma.	I wasn't optimistic, but I was desperate and it was worth a shot.	I have been using it for 3 weeks, and I have seen quite an improvement already. The texture of my scars have changed, and the color has faded so much that whenever I put makeup on you can't even see my scars anymore.	On most days I can only do one application (before I go to bed), but on days where I don't have to wear makeup all day I can do 3 applications.	I have no problems with the smell, especially it being so close to my nose. Smells like old flowers or something, but it goes away after a couple of minutes. I also have no problems with itching. I read on one website that you need to rub it in hard and make sure it is fully absorbed.	I also started wearing sun block on my face spf70 when I go outside.

B000052YOB,2008,0,5.0,18,20,462,"Mederma is better than Patroleum jelly/Neosporin","I recently had abdominal and chest surgery and my doctor recommended Mederma once the wounds had healed and all of the stitches were out (6 weeks post-op). My new wounds stretch from hip to hip and essentially armpit to armpit (under each breast to try to conceal it as much as possible). I decided to also apply Mederma to some old scars I have (a few stretch marks on my belly and an old piercing scar in my navel). I have only been using it for three days and I already can see a reduction in the redness of the new scars. My skin has also begun peeling which doesn't hurt at all and I read online that this is a good thing; it means the skin is renewing itself. I find its odor to be non-offensive and vaguely lemony and once the product rubs into the skin (which is quickly) it goes away altogether. This product is not messy (which I appreciate because up until I started using it I had been using Neosporin and wrapping the oily mess under gauze to keep it from making grease stains on my clothes and just wiping off) and it doesn't burn or itch at all after I apply it. I have heard great reviews that it can reduce many scars up to 90%! I am excited to see how my scars will look in a few months time of using this product.		I also read a report that tries to compare Mederma to the use of Petroleum jelly and they just don't compare, the method of effectiveness as well as the physical properties of the two are completely different and I stated as such in a response to that review similar to what I am stating here.		I have read that some people are allergic to this product. I don't know if it is the active ingredient (the onion extract) or the vehicle (I notice that it contains PEG-4) and if you apply too much it may leave a mark (because it changes the physical composition of previously damaged skin by causing re-organization of the collagen and other components of the scar and if you mix it with other cleaners and skin products it can cause burning - so follow the directions!) It is also a little pricey in my opinion (I paid $18 for a tube of less than one ounce and I know I will be buying more if I am going to be using it on such big scars for 2-6 months - probably lots more, even tho a little bit does go a long way) but if you are self-concious about some scars or just would like them to be less noticeable (like me) I would recommend this product."

There is still a scar but it has lost most of the ugly, snarled appearance it started off with. The marks from the thread used to sew his arm are nearly gone. The scar itself is a pale pink color.

Because of how well it has worked so far for him, I intend to purchase some of the stretch mark cream once my baby is born in February. I will also post updates as his arm continues to heal.

I have a friend who used Mederma for 3 years on his scar and now you can barely see it. So it just might take more than 4 months to see results, despite the product claims. I'll keep using it for at least 6 months to a year, and then re-evaluate the situation.		Even though it may be doing nothing, it makes me feel good to put the Mederma on every day. It makes me feel like I am actively doing something about this problem (my scars). It gives me hope and self-esteem to know that I am taking action to better myself.		One problem with Mederma is it really dries out my skin, to the point of causing mild irritation when I use it. To combat this dryness I also use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AI97MA"">Bio-oil 4.2oz</a> which is another scar treatment that also moisturizes the skin.

I have a large skin graft on my lower leg that was kept covered by strips that had a petroleum jelly substance on it until it healed. Even with that, there is a scar and petroleum jelly isn't going to lighten it! I had a roughly 6 inch long scar on my are from trying to get my cat out of a fight that was super dark and ugly! I started putting mederma on it, like another person said, you have to keep at it! In time the scar went from raised, dark, and ugly to a thin, pail line that is barely raised. Most people never notice it. This product DOES work! Just make sure you understand that it is not magic so it takes time and repeated applications and, if it is a large scar, such as my graft, it is expensive.

My initial scar was a deep redish/purple color and it has now faded to a medium-dark redish color.  The color did not fade significantly or disappear as the example on the tube suggested it would; however it seems to have improved somewhat.  I don't know what the scar would have looked like had I not used any Mederma but simply waited for time to heal the scar, but I didn't want to take any chances.  I bought the larger 1.76 oz tube after I realized that I was going to use up the smaller size fairly quickly with that many daily applications.  The big tube is a much better value depending on the price so I just ended up keeping the small tube at work.  This made it easier to apply Mederma 3 times a day.		I also had many small scars in various places from the liposuction and started using Scar Reducing Herbal Creme just for those scars.  I have used that product for about 6 weeks.  My two main scars were the size of quarters and are now half the size of a dime and definitely faded.  Scar Reducing Creme uses Olive Oil so it's easier to spread and a little goes a long way. Since Mederma is very light and water based, it doesn't spread as easily and seems to soak in quickly to dry skin, but it has also lasted for these last two months with extra in the tube to spare.		I thought it would be good idea to try StriVectin on my stomach (just above the tummy tuck scar) since I had bad stretch marks.  I figured I could put all the cremes on at the same time since it's such a ritual anyway.  I didn't mix the cremes by applying one over the other but applied each of the three to separate parts of my body.  I didn't see any difference in the stretch marks at first and probably missed a few applications for this reason, but my husband started telling me that he really noticed a difference so I'm back using it again. Now looking at my stomach I think I agree with him, the marks are less noticeable than right after the procedure.  Now that it's been 2 months, I plan to start rotating different scar cremes such as Scarzone along with the Mederma.  Another review said that silicone may work better so I will give this a try while the scar is still relatively new.  If none of this fades the scar completely, I'll make an appointment with a dermatologist to try laser or chemical peels.  I love the results of the lipo/tummy tuck but I hate this scar!"

I'd say it made a pretty good improvement too, but that came with a price. When this stuff dries, a little clear film it left on your skin. The worst part about it is the itching. It didn't itch everywhere I put it but when fighting a massive scar on my chest- it just got to be unbearable. Because it's like this, I'd apply it in the morning after my shower. Film-y stuff forms. Itch starts an hour later. Then I had to reapply mid-day. Another film-y layer forms... Ugh and it continued. I stuck it out for the most part but I never lasted as long as I should.. it was just unbearable. So I've switched to the all natural derma-e scar gel and it's amazing.

Now I have to use another product to lighten the dark spots.  If you are a Black woman, like me, and prone to hyperpigmentation, do not use this product!!!"
B000052YOB,2010,9,4.0,8,8,548,"Works on new somewhat serious burns, PATIENCE is required","BOTTOM LINE - the product works with MULTIPLE DAILY applications and it takes MONTHS for the results to show, much longer than what the Mederma manufacturer states (It will probably be well over a year by the time my scars fully resolve - but that's better than having the scars, right?).  For more details on my experience..read on.		I sustained burns on my legs, one of which was quite deep and infected, it required heavy duty oral antibiotics (Augmentin) for weeks to heal.  For context, I have an olive skin complexion.		The worst burn initially healed with a jelly-like puckered up texture - nothing like regular skin, purplish in color.  The original size of that burn was about the size of nickel, with the most ""jelly"" in the middle and less raised in the edges.  The burn is now about half the size of a dime, what is left is still quite ugly but changing.  I've been conscientiously applying Mederma TWICE (2x) per day - morning and night - and I rub it in when I apply it.  I've been doing this now for NINE (9) months, so the process is not a fast one, but it IS working (and I've witnessed the slow contraction of the scar over the months).  I do not believe that the skin would have healed like this on its own.  Upon reading about burn scars, the type of scar I described can be dealt with by surgically removing the weird skin and sawing up the skin around it (read expensive cosmetic procedure, and you're still left with the scar from bringing the skin together).		The next to worse burns are two other scars which healed with indentations and very dark pigmentation.  Those two scars no longer have indentations, that is to say the skin has ""filled in"".  I also think the dark pigmentation is starting to get lighter, but as I obsessively look at the scars daily that sort of progress is hard to gage.		Why not 5 stars?  The downside - the Mederma product instruction/claims are of a much shorter duration in recovery than experienced by me.  Nine months (and ongoing) is NOT the 8 weeks promised for new scars, it's not even the 6 months promised for old scars!!  Note that the manufacturer's instructions recommend applying Mederma 3-4x/day and for practical reasons I apply the Mederma only 2Xs per day; so there's the possibility that I would have healed faster had I used it that often?  Another possibility is that the manufacturer meant for the scarring that takes 6 months to heal to be more benign than whatever degree burns I sustained.		Another negative observation is that I can still see some of the burns that were very superficial - they healed like regular scars and I still have much darker skin in that area (note that I apply the Mederma with the same schedule/intensity as I apply it to the serious burn scars).  As I mentioned before I'm olive skinned, so perhaps people with lighter pigments will experience a faster fading of their scar.		A conclusion I draw from my experience is that perhaps Mederma will give painfully slow results to those seeking to lighten minor scars?  As I have a lot of product I will continue to apply."

This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel.

After I first began using the product, that area of my face began to turn red and it would flake off after about a half hour of application. I've been using Mederma for about 3-4 weeks now and the redness from using the product has stopped and best of all, the scars on my face caused by acne have been greatly reduced! I am going to continue to use Mederma for about another month but until that time I'm proud to say I'm not near as embarrassed in public, and I don't have to worry about showing my 'good side' any more.

This was proof enough for me that Neutrogena has the same results as the Olay system for much less money and hassle."

I was beginning to look at my hands and see my mother's wrinkled, age-spotted hands - yikes!  I started using a pearl-sized dab on the tops of my hands daily as well and see a huge difference.  While there's considerably less retinol than in a prescription retinol cream, it's also about a tenth of the price of what my dermatologist prescribed (which I never filled after pricing it)."

I've got it all, plus super sensitive skin. I've been using this product during the day and even sometimes at night for a few weeks now with no irritation and great results. Some of my friends had mentioned another product that might be even better, so I briefly switched to RoC's Deep Wrinkle line. OMG. I only lasted two days using it because of the perfumes and the general heaviness/oiliness I experienced, not to mention it made my eyes water (and I didn't even put any around my eyes). I took those products back, needless to say. The grass is always greener--not.		Neutrogena Healthy Skin is a great line in general. I now use the eye cream and the night creme as well as the day creme. I will stick with this line and not stray again. It goes on silky, no oily feel, no harsh perfumes, and no skin or eye irritation (and I use it around my eyes). I wake up looking a little brighter every day. Deeper smile lines and brow furrows are softening more and more, skin is more even and sun damage is lightening up. :)		Love the line. Works for me."

This moisturizer is the perfect combination of vitamins and moisture; my skin feels instantly revived.

I will definitely continue to purchase and use it. The suggestions on the uses of the product are true, and I can't wait to see the continued results that it says I should expect.

I haven't noticed any improvements in my fine lines or wrinkles, but I'm using it more as a preventative measure (I'm 34 currently).

The men's version has SPF junk in it that flakes quite a bit as you rub it in...this healthy skin version fortunately doesn't do that as much...as it seems to be more moist.  I'm a 36 year old male, but since I've been using this the past 2 weeks I look closer to 20-25.  Doormen at clubs don't believe that my ID is real lately...LOL...I've had to show 2-3 other IDs with it.  On the other hand, the men's version also helps make me look younger, but less so at about 25-30.	I've experimented with almost a dozen face creams over the past year, with most of those being Neutrogena products.  This is going to be my new face mosisturizer from now on.

It's been 2 months now. I'm 25, but have small forehead and eye wrinkles due to living in CA and never using sunscreen. I put this cream on my face every single day, and my wrinkles have not gotten smaller, like the description says - ""prevents and reduces appearance of existing wrinkles."" WRONG. There is NO noticeable difference in my face after 2 months.		However, this cream is GREAT for age spots. Last year I started getting ugly brown raised bumps, age spots, on the backs of my hands. I've been putting it on the backs of my hands for 2 months now, and within the first week it bleached out the brown. The raised bumps are still there, but you can't notice them because my hands are all regular skin colored again. Thank goodness. With experimenting, though, I've found that if I stop using the cream for a week, the brown starts to come back. I think it just bleaches it, but I really don't know. Anyway, it's nice that the spots are gone.		It didn't do anything for the red sun spots on my chest like some reviewers said it did.

It comes in a tube, so there is no dipping the fingertips into the jar, which I always wondered about contamination-wise.

I bought it because Dr Oz recommended a retinal cream to stop the signs of sun damage, and although I am not ""wrinkle cream"" age, I spend a lot of time in the sun, so I am worried about sun damage.  On the Oprah website, they listed several that were recommended, and this was the cheapest and easiest to find, so I thought it would be the first I tried. I am so happy with the results, this is all I need to try.  Right away, I noticed my skin looked ""brighter""  hard to explain, but that is the only way I can describe it.  After about a week of daily use, my pores look smaller, and my face feels amazingly smooth.  I feel like I can wear less make up.  I don't have wrinkles yet, so I can't comment on that, but hopefully continued use will help prevent bad ones (I'm realistic, I know I'll get some, but maybe they wont be so deep)The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I feel that I need a bit more moisturizing on some areas of my face, so I end up using more that the pearl sized amount, maybe double.

B000EGMHKQ,2010,2,5.0,62,63,419,"Affordable Luxury in A Tiny Bottle!","Listen to me ~ if you believe none of the other reviews I am here to tell you this product is a miracle!  I rarely write letters to companies but this one did it for me.  I had to let them know they've got the right stuff!		I am 42 and have had combination skin that gets much oilier during the warmer months.  This product is one that I have used for two years now exclusively as my night oil and it has become a mainstay in my cabinet.		Here's the trick, though.  After cleansing my face (I also use Olivella bar soap) I leave my face dripping wet.  One short pump and those few drops glide over my entire face, my ears AND the front and back of my neck.  It doesn't take much at all but a moist face just isn't enough.  Just massage it in as your face air dries and the moisture left behind is heavenly.  Not the slightest bit oily at all.  And don't skip your lips.  No fine lines around mine and my lipstick proves it - no more creeping into fine lines around my lips.  They're smooth now.		I have a tendency to be a night owl so I often don't wait until before bed to apply this wonderful elixir.  If I know I'll be working late into the night, I'll apply it in the early evening and allow it to work overtime.		What's ironic is that when I first started using the soap, I couldn't justify the cost of this moisturizer.  It seemed far too much for such a little bit.  But when I consider how much cream I had to scoop out of jars over the years, this is now an actually very inexpensive product with so much promise.  I assure you whatever your complexion, your skin will thank you for adding this to the regimen.		I no longer use an eye cream, no special neck cream at all - all I need is Olivella and my skin thanks me every day.  Finally a product worthy of a letter and a review.  Do try it and again, do not apply to merely moist or dry skin.  Wetter is better and as an extra treat, when you're done, rub the residue into your cuticles.  Even my manicurist is shocked over how I no longer have raggedy cuticles that I've suffered since forever.		Miracle in a bottle for sure!		I get it at Harmon's in my neighborhood for around $15 and change."
B000EGMHKQ,2007,5,4.0,28,29,266,"Overall a GREAT product","First and foremost what i love about this product is that it's natural, is not used in animal testing, and has a very low toxicity rate (according to ewg.org) with no cancer causing chemicals, unlike most of the common moisturizers out there. All it takes is a few drops to cover the face and works best after a shower. The scent is moderately strong soap-type smell but will not stay with you for long, although some may not be pleased with it. It absorbs into the skin rather quickly so your face does not seem oily.		I find Olivella is best used overnight because when i woke up i had a fresh young glow to my skin and was pleased with the results. Some should be advised that you may be allergic to the ingredients and do a test before hand. Even if you are not allergic, when i first used the product my skin did break out but i had remembered reading somewhere how since the it can actually help normalize your skin that breakouts are sometimes a common thing in the beginning so i continued to use it.

When I realized It was the detergent, I stopped it immediately and although the symptoms subsided, after a week, I still had severely irritated patches of skin in my bra and panty areas. Because I cannot take Antihistamines, everything I tried had to be topical and NOTHING helped. After three weeks of torture, and no logic to support why Olivella would work when the prescribed creams didn't,I gave it a try. WELL, after just one day the itching was gone. After three days, the rough dry areas were back to normal color and by the end of the week, all symptoms were completely gone. I've used a lot of olive oil products but the virgin oil moisturizer is by far, a must-have."

I also haven't had any further breakouts since I started using it. I put it on every night before bed and my skin has never been softer.

One family member just had surgery on her face for skin cancer. I sent her some, since it better for you than all those items with so many harsh chemicals. I figured she had enough of facial harshness for a bit. She loves this stuff. It is helping to make her face feel comforted and soft, yes, even at the scar.

I was however tempted to try the product despite all because of the great reviews and the fact that i have been looking for an olive oil based moisturizer. it boils down to this, even if i am still angry at the seller i will order again because the product is awesome.	the moisturizer smells great, i have no idea why some people think it is too much fragrance, the smell is subtle and almost citrus like. it goes on well and is not thick by any measure, especially when you take a minute to massage is gently on your face as the instructions tell you to. Also make sure your face is wet, seems to help more with the absorption. i love how my face feels when i wake up in the morning. super soft and moisturized. the design of the bottle is nice too because the pump ensures you only take out as much as you need. so yes i would recommend this product. i just hope the seller does not mess up again."

I like that this one has squalene and a mild scent to it. I have oily skin so this is too oily for me to use during the day but its great at night. I've used it after doing an at-home light peel with 10% salicylic acid and much to my surprise I woke up with no chapped skin. It didn't burn or irritate my skin at all afterwards, whereas most face creams would. I will continue to use for this purpose (post peel face protector) and for days when my face is especially dry."
B000EGMHKQ,2011,11,5.0,0,0,255,"Very pleased with product","I prefer natural or mostly natural health care products and this one doesn't disappoint. The ingredients are simple but effective. As other reviewers have noted, it seems to work best when your skin is warm and moist, immediately after washing your face or jumping out of the shower. It soaks right in and doesn't leave my sensitive, combination skin with excess oil build up. I use up any leftover oil on my decollete and hands.		I sometimes suffer from rosacea, especially during the cold months when our house is dry and if I eat any sugar during that time it stresses my skin enough that I end up with rosacea. Olivella has helped to nearly eliminate my rosacea. My excessively dry eyebrows are nearly perfectly smooth now and the skin on my cheeks feels younger and more supple.		Even though I have extremely sensitive skin, the slight fragrance in this product does not bother me. The main ingredient is extra virgin olive oil and it also contains squalene, a natural oil produced by the human skin that hydrates and contains antioxidants to help with repair and aging, which sadly, means all skin types after the age of 30. I recognize that everyone's body is different, but I think this is a wonderful product. It has saved me heaps of money on the organic skin care products I was using before. A note for anyone else who has sensitive skin like mine, try replacing your facial wash with raw, unfiltered honey, then applying Olivella after rinsing."
B000EGMHKQ,2011,9,5.0,0,0,348,"Moisturizer + Make-up Remover Before Bed","I am a person with sensitive skin, that gets super oily during the day and uncomfortably dry when cleaned. When I use regular cream moisturizer, it irritates my skin making it itchy sometimes. However, when I use Olivella, my skin feels a lot better, I want to say it soothes my skin, but not to that extent. I just know that when my skin is dry, the dryness disappears right after I use this.		I use this every night, after a shower, but I use veerrry little. Like half of the droplet goes on my slightly dampened skin. And what makes this product convenient is, because it's oil-based, it naturally becomes a make-up remover without the chemicals. So I just gently brush the eyeliner under my eyes with my finger (not with a towel cause thats bad for your eyes) and wipe my finger on a napkin (If I need more oil, I just use a bit of the remaining half of the droplet).		Next, I can use the remaining on my hair just on the top part where my hair separates so the tiny hairs don't stick up in the air. It adds a bit of shine to my hair as well.		Lastly, I rub it in my hands, and i'm all ready for bed :D		In conclusion	-its great instant relief for my oily clean that gets really dry when cleaned	-don't cause acne for my skin type	-can be used as a make-remover while moisturizing my face	-relaxing smell	-adds shine and smoothens up my hair(but dont use it on strands of hair or it'll make u look like you haven't washed ur hair in days. Use very little)	-if used in moderation, doesn't look like you have oily skin	-If done after a shower with damp face and wake up in morning, will not look oily at all. Instead, will feel soft and un-oily	-Last a long time if used in moderation (I just use one-two drops a day) had it for so long I don't even remember how long its been. (maybe 4-5months?)"

The one thing I would put on ""con"" side is that this product does not get absorbed well. I somewhat understand b/c this is ""oil"" rather than ""cream""type, but I still expected this not to be much oily.		but, again, I guess this one is pretty good compared to many other facial oils, but not as much as DHC virgin facia oil. and the reason why i bought this Olivella virgin oil(it said to be 100% virgin oil, but I honestly dont believe this with 100 percent) is mainly because DHC's product is so expensive. so, compared to each of price and funciton, I would say I am pretty satisfied with this Olivella's oil.

My only complaint is that it makes my face so moist that when I have my cell phone up to my cheek or I touch my cheek my make up comes off with oil all over it. I have to really wipe my cell phone off after talking on the phone b/c there's so much oil on my face coming through my make up. I don't put too much on in my opinion. I use 2 pumps . 1 pump barely gets me past my cheeks , so two gets up to my forehead and I could really use just a little tiny pump, but I stop at 2. So I don't think I'm lathering tons of oil on my face needlessly. Besides that, I love this moisturizer and will never use another moisturizer if I can help it. Buy this!		UPDATE:	I just decided today to try putting this on right after my shower like it had suggested. I was skeptical to try that at first b/c water and oil don't mix. I guess I was nervous some type of separation would happen with the oil on my face! lol. But I tried it immediately after getting out of the shower today with only one pump instead of two and WHAT A DIFFERENCE that made. I had no idea using it when my face was still a little moist would really help with the absorption that much and it doesn't feel like my face is covered in oil anymore. It was a good moisturizer before, but now using it the way it was recommended ( my fault for not doing so sooner! ) I completely understand why they tell you to do it that way and recommend it even more!"

All it takes is a few drops to cover the face and works best after a shower. The scent is moderately strong soap-type smell but will not stay with you for long, although some may not be pleased with it. It absorbs into the skin rather quickly so your face does not seem oily.		I find Olivella is best used overnight because when i woke up i had a fresh young glow to my skin and was pleased with the results. Some should be advised that you may be allergic to the ingredients and do a test before hand. Even if you are not allergic, when i first used the product my skin did break out but i had remembered reading somewhere how since the it can actually help normalize your skin that breakouts are sometimes a common thing in the beginning so i continued to use it. I'm glad i did because it definitely proves it's worth keeping.

I am hoping to have another baby and recent studies suggest that women who are pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, should avoid retinyl palmitate.  I went with Olivella because the bottle said 100% Virgin Olive Oil.  I have been using it for the past week, and imagine my surprise when I glanced at the ingredients list to see what they had used to scent the oil (because it doesn't smell like olive oil) and found, among other things, retinyl palmitate!  Not exactly 100% virgin olive oil!  While there might be a small amount of vitamin A in olive oil, it seems that they have added more (as well as citrus oil, and a number of flower oils that provide its pleasant fragrance).  I am sorely disappointed!"

I have dry to combination skin and was worried about slathering straight oil on my face - wouldn't that make me break out or clog my pores or make me strangely shiny?! Nope, nope, and....not really. It is a bit greasy going on.....after all, this is almost straight olive oil....but just put it on before bed with a slightly damp face and let it work its magic. I love putting it on after I shower or exfoliate because where my skin would feel uncomfortably tight and dry and sometimes flaky before, this takes care of all that. As an added bonus, my makeup foundation just glides right on with this stuff, although be careful with eye shadow as it might interfere with adhesion if it hasn't absorbed enough yet. This is an awesome product which is an excellent choice for men too and people of all ages. Gentle, natural, and effective. What's not to love?"
B000EGMHKQ,2011,5,5.0,1,1,48,"Feels Like a Good Treatment","Love this - it does feel a bit greasy, but also totally nourishing.  It's not just a moisturizer, it's like a moisture serum.  The mild citrus smell is really nice.  I suffer from dry patches on my face sometimes and after two days of this, they're totally gone."
B000EGMHKQ,2011,3,5.0,1,1,43,"Excellent moisturizer","I definitely love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  I have seen an improvement in my skin, not only in the softness but also a reduction in wrinkles.  You don't need chemicals to have nice skin.  Mother nature has it all."
B000EGMHKQ,2011,3,5.0,1,1,451,"**THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH IN A BOTTLE!!!**","There are many reasons why you get brown spots on your skin (pregnancy hormones, pigmentation problems due to a pimple, exposure to sun, and just plain age). I did some research and found that there are three HUGE solutions that, combined together can stop the spot from getting darker, and start to heal it. There are three major factors that work together  to help treat, eliminate and hide the brown spot. Here's what I found:		1)ALWAYS WEAR SUNSCREEN! This is definitely crucial, otherwise no matter the cause of the age spot, it WILL get bigger if your skin does not have adequate protection from the sun. I wear Oil of Olay Daily Moisture Lotion w/SPF on top of this product.		2)Citric Acid is a key all natural bleaching ingredient. This coming from fruits such as oranges and lemons, lemons having the highest amount of citric acid.		2)Olive Oil! Yes the same thing that works on hands to soften them also works good for brown spots. The Vitamin E in the Olive Oil moisturizes your skin, and stimulates the cells in your skin to regenerate. This is especially good in its most raw form because in order to remove the dark spot, you have to treat through 21 layers of skin!		3) Athough this product does not include buttermilk, I still apply buttermilk twice a week to the spot (and my face) twice a week in addition to this product. Get ready to plug your nose because it works best if it's spoiled! I put mine in a pump bottle that dispenses nail polish remover. I use a cotton swab, dab a couple times then wipe off.		I have one brown spot (and there's no way I'm posting a pic of it). I noticed it after a pimple healed. But I was also in my first trimester of pregnancy. So hormonal or because of the pimple or both? Not sure. But, from the first week I started using this product it worked immediately!! The bottle is extremely slow but a little goes a SUPER long way! I only use a tiny bit each night and under makeup. Make sure to massage it in well. After all, it is an oil!!!		This is truly an INCREDIBLE product!!! A+++! Here's the major ingredients that make it work (that actually back up the research I did: Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Squalene, Citris Aurantium, Dulcis (Orange), Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lavadula Angustifiola (Lavender) Oil, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil. **THIS IS THE INGREDIENT LIST IN IT'S EXACT ORDER.**		Before expensive and sometimes dangerous medical routines to remove brown spots, try this! I love it and I will continue using it every single day.....You WON'T regret it!"
B000EGMHKQ,2011,0,5.0,1,1,98,"Miracle in a bottle!","You guys! I bought this on a whim after reading its reviews with an amazon gift card I received for xmas and WOW! I swear, my face has never been in such good shape! I'm 19 and have mild acne so I was worried it would break me out but not at all, it really does its job as a great moisturizer. Very soothing and not oily or greasy at all - I am totally not a fan of shine and wouldn't use this or recommend it if I wasn't very happy! 5 for Olivella! You go Olivella!"
B000EGMHKQ,2010,8,5.0,1,1,22,"Smooth Skin","My husband has very dry skin. This Olivella Olive oil is great it is the first thing that is working for him."
B000EGMHKQ,2011,2,2.0,1,2,51,"Good idea not executed very well...","Olive oil is indeed very good for you, whether taken internally or slathered on the skin.  The price for this brand of skin oil is better than that of DHC, but the citrusy fragrance and spout that spits out more than I need are definite minuses.  Otherwise it's a decent moisturizer."
B000EGMHKQ,2011,1,3.0,1,2,71,"Nothing special","I don't think this product is very good for an older person (59) with dry skin.  It seems to just evaporate off the surface and leaves my skin looking very dry in the morning. It might be good for cleansing or using with another product over it.  I will not buy it again and have to look for something else.  The scent is a little bit strong for sensitive people, also."
B000EGMHKQ,2009,1,5.0,1,2,17,"I love this product!!","HI,	This is a wonderful product.  It is very helpful in a dry climate like Colorado.	Thanks!!"
B000EGMHKQ,2012,11,5.0,0,1,20,"Something for my sister","dont really know how it works but got it for my sister. I think she knows what she asked for."
B000EGMHKQ,2011,2,2.0,0,2,119,"Why buy this...when you can use straight up Olive Oil!!","Unless you have the dryest of all dryest skin types...dont go for this!  im sure its good for those with dry/flaky skin..but even then...you can only dab a bit of this.  I have combination skin..but bought it as an overnight moisturizer..since it is known to be a great anti-oxidant....but what happened instead was I put a small amount over my face, and neck, and my hair kept getting stuck on my face because it was soooo thick!  it was like putting pure Olive Oil on my skin....really thats all it really is!!  Again...I wont knock it for those who have ultry-dry skin...but wearing an itty-bitty amount is good.  Or..you can just buy olive oil and do it yourself ;)"
B000EGMHKQ,2011,7,2.0,0,3,74,"Quite Disappointed","The product claims ""Magnificent anti-aging Elixir truly replenishes and revitalizes your skin while your body is at rest, during sleep."".  I actually found that skin looks worse.  I am suspect that many of the reviews (like many on Amazon) are written by the company.  It does nothing for my skin.		If I want to buy a natural product, I find Wholefoods a much better resource.  The staff tends to be knowledgeable and quite honest."
B000EGMHKQ,2012,11,1.0,0,6,38,seriously,"i havent tried this product yet, i am writing because i just received it in the mail and it came all oily, the box was all oily so apparently it spilled and wasnt packaged right... already a bummer."
